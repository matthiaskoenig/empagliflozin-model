AB  - Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the latest class of drugs 
      to be introduced for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These drugs 
      improve glycemic control by increasing urinary glucose excretion and exert 
      additional benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reductions. Areas covered: 
      This review outlines the background to SGLT2 inhibitors and provides details on 
      the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy of empagliflozin and 
      discusses the cardiovascular outcome trial. Expert opinion: Empagliflozin was the 
      first from a new group of antidiabetic drugs to show benefits in a cardiovascular 
      outcome trial. There were significant reductions in cardiovascular and all-cause 
      mortality and empagliflozin treatment reduced hospitalizations for heart failure 
      and reduced the progression of diabetic nephropathy. These benefits, which 
      occurred at a very early stage during the study, may be related to a reduction in 
      circulating volume or changes in metabolic fuel utilization in the heart and 
      kidneys. Whether these effects are shared by other SGLT2 inhibitors is not yet 
      known, but there may be differences between drugs related to selectivity for 
      inhibition of SGLT2 compared to SGLT1 or other pharmacological effects. Currently 
      the outcome evidence is only available to support the use of empagliflozin in 
      this drug class.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus: the latest developments.

LID - 10.1080/17425255.2018.1551877 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disorder associated with 
      high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Some of the therapeutic strategies are 
      contraindicated in patients with concomitant heart disease. However, the newest 
      antidiabetic medications, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have 
      shown to significantly reduce CV mortality and heart failure (HF) 
      hospitalizations. The mechanism behind these surprising cardiac benefits remains 
      unclear. Areas covered: This article reviews the pharmacokinetic, 
      pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety data for the different SGLT2 inhibitors. 
      Specific attention is devoted to the postulated mechanisms of action for their 
      benefit. The therapeutic efficacy and potential use in different indications 
      outside T2DM such as HF, T1DM, and renal disease are also discussed. Expert 
      opinion: SGLT2 inhibitors have an excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profile. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are a safe and efficacious treatment 
      option for T2DM. Given their cardiac benefits (reduction in HF and death) and the 
      low incidence of adverse events, SGLT2 inhibitors are being currently studied as 
      a treatment for HF also in nondiabetic individuals. These agents seem to 
      represent a shift in the treatment of HF patients regardless their glycemic 
      profile.

TI  - Empagliflozin in Heart Failure: Diuretic and Cardiorenal Effects.
PG  - 1028-1039
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.045691 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors improve heart 
      failure-related outcomes. The mechanisms underlying these benefits are not well 
      understood, but diuretic properties may contribute. Traditional diuretics such as 
      furosemide induce substantial neurohormonal activation, contributing to the 
      limited improvement in intravascular volume often seen with these agents. 
      However, the proximal tubular site of action of the sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors may help circumvent these limitations. METHODS: Twenty 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic, stable heart failure 
      completed a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of empagliflozin 10 mg 
      daily versus placebo. Patients underwent an intensive 6-hour biospecimen 
      collection and cardiorenal phenotyping at baseline and again after 14 days of 
      study drug. After a 2-week washout, patients crossed over to the alternate 
      therapy with the above protocol repeated. RESULTS: Oral empagliflozin was rapidly 
      absorbed as evidenced by a 27-fold increase in urinary glucose excretion by 3 
      hours (P<0.0001). Fractional excretion of sodium increased significantly with 
      empagliflozin monotherapy versus placebo (fractional excretion of sodium, 
      1.2±0.7% versus 0.7±0.4%; P=0.001), and there was a synergistic effect in 
      combination with bumetanide (fractional excretion of sodium, 5.8±2.5% versus 
      3.9±1.9%; P=0.001). At 14 days, the natriuretic effect of empagliflozin 
      persisted, resulting in a reduction in blood volume (-208 mL [interquartile 
      range, -536 to 153 mL] versus -14 mL [interquartile range, -282 to 335 mL]; 
      P=0.035) and plasma volume (-138 mL, interquartile range, -379 to 154±453 mL; 
      P=0.04). This natriuresis was not, however, associated with evidence of 
      neurohormonal activation because the change in norepinephrine was superior 
      (P=0.02) and all other neurohormones were similar (P<0.34) during the 
      empagliflozin versus placebo period. Furthermore, there was no evidence of 
      potassium wasting (P=0.20) or renal dysfunction (P>0.11 for all biomarkers), 
      whereas both serum magnesium (P<0.001) and uric acid levels (P=0.008) improved. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin causes significant natriuresis, particularly when 
      combined with loop diuretics, resulting in an improvement in blood volume. 
      However, off-target electrolyte wasting, renal dysfunction, and neurohormonal 
      activation were not observed. This favorable diuretic profile may offer 
      significant advantage in the management of volume status in patients with heart 
      failure and may represent a mechanism contributing to the superior long-term 
      heart failure outcomes observed with these agents. Registration: URL:

TI  - Comparison of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Two Empagliflozin 
      Formulations in Healthy Korean Subjects.
PG  - 2137-2145
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S409368 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that is 
      commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. As cocrystal 
      formulation can improve the chemical properties of drugs, CKD-370 was newly 
      developed as a cocrystal formulation of empagliflozin with solvate L-proline. 
      This study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of 
      these two empagliflozin formulations in healthy Korean subjects. METHODS: A 
      randomized, open-label, two-sequence, two-period crossover study was conducted on 
      healthy Korean participants. The subjects received a single oral 25 mg dose of 
      either test (CKD-370) or reference treatment (Jardiance(®)) tablet at each 
      period. Plasma empagliflozin concentrations were determined using liquid 
      chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters 
      were analyzed using non-compartmental methods. The primary PK parameters included 
      the maximum concentration (C(max)) and the area under the concentration-time 
      curve from 0 to last (AUC(last)). The safety of both formulations was monitored 
      and evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 28 healthy Korean adult subjects were 
      randomized, and 27 subjects were included in the PK analysis. The mean ± standard 
      deviation values of the primary PK parameters, C(max) and AUC(last) after 
      administration of the test treatment, were 442.02 ± 103.37 μg/L and 3131.08 ± 
      529.30 μg·h/L, respectively, and those after administration of the reference 
      treatment were 436.29 ± 118.74 μg/L and 3006.88 ± 514.21 μg·h/L, respectively. 
      The geometric mean ratio and its 90% confidence interval of test to reference 
      treatment for C(max) and AUC(last) were 1.0221 (0.9527-1.0967) and 1.0411 
      (1.0153-1.0677), respectively, which were within the commonly accepted 
      bioequivalence criteria of 0.80 to 1.25. Both treatments were well-tolerated. 
      CONCLUSION: The two formulations of empagliflozin showed similar PK 
      characteristics and were generally well tolerated in healthy subjects.

AB  - The current study is a randomized, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, two-way 
      crossover pharmacokinetic study in healthy Jordanian subjects to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence profile of two cases of empagliflozin 10 mg 
      under fasting and fed conditions. The plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were 
      determined using an HPLC-MS/MS method. Tolerability and safety were assessed 
      throughout the study. This study included 26 subjects, 26 in both fasting and fed 
      groups.The pharmacokinetic parameters, which included the area under the 
      concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-inf)) and the final 
      quantifiable concentration (AUC(0-last)), maximum serum concentration (C(max)), 
      and time to reach the maximum drug concentration (T(max)) were found to be within 
      an equivalence margin of 80.00-125.00%. The pharmacokinetic profiles show that 
      the empagliflozin test and parent reference cases were bioequivalent in healthy 
      subjects. The two treatments' safety evaluations were also comparable.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin in patients with 
      heart failure.
LID - 10.1111/bcp.16099 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work is to compare empagliflozin systemic exposure between 
      patients with heart failure (HF) and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). 
      METHODS: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) compared steady state trough 
      concentrations of empagliflozin 10 mg in EMPEROR-reduced (patients with HF with 
      reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]) and EMPA-REG OUTCOME (patients with T2D at 
      high cardiovascular risk) after adjusting for eGFR and body weight. RESULTS: The 
      difference in geometric Mean (gMean) empagliflozin steady state trough 
      concentration of 10 mg empagliflozin between EMPEROR-reduced and EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
      was 1.47-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33, 1.63). Additionally, ANCOVA 
      for the sub-group of patients with both T2D and HF conditions revealed a 
      difference in gMean steady state trough concentration of 1.53-fold (95% CI: 1.26, 
      1.85). In both patients with HFrEF and HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), there was no 
      major difference in empagliflozin steady state trough exposure by New York Heart 
      Association (NYHA) classification or by use of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin 
      inhibitor as comedication. A weak positive correlation was observed for NT-proBNP 
      at Week 12 and empagliflozin steady state trough concentration in both patients 
      with HFrEF and HFpEF (Pearson correlation r = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma 
      concentrations of empagliflozin in patients with HF were higher compared to 
      patients with T2D, but the exposure resulting from the 10 mg dose was still below 
      the exposure resulting from the dose of 25 mg approved in patients with T2D. The 
      difference in exposure was attributable to demographic characteristics and 
      HF-induced pathophysiological changes. Overall, the results confirm 10 mg as the 
      appropriate empagliflozin dose in patients with HF.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate the effects of coadministration of the sodium 
      glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin with the 
      thiazolidinedione pioglitazone. METHODS: In study 1, 20 healthy volunteers 
      received 50 mg of empagliflozin alone for 5 days, followed by 50 mg of 
      empagliflozin coadministered with 45 mg of pioglitazone for 7 days and 45 mg of 
      pioglitazone alone for 7 days in 1 of 2 treatment sequences. In study 2, 20 
      volunteers received 45 mg of pioglitazone alone for 7 days and 10, 25, and 50 mg 
      of empagliflozin for 9 days coadministered with 45 mg of pioglitazone for the 
      first 7 days in 1 of 4 treatment sequences. FINDINGS: Pioglitazone exposure (Cmax 
      and AUC) increased when coadministered with empagliflozin versus monotherapy in 
      study 1. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) for pioglitazone Cmax at steady state 
      (Cmax,ss) and for AUC during the dosing interval at steady state (AUCτ,ss) when 
      coadministered with empagliflozin versus administration alone was 187.89% (95% 
      CI, 166.35%-212.23%) and 157.97% (95% CI, 148.02%-168.58%), respectively. Because 
      an increase in pioglitazone exposure was not expected, based on in vitro data, a 
      second study was conducted with the empagliflozin doses tested in Phase III 
      trials. In study 2, pioglitazone exposure decreased marginally when 
      coadministered with empagliflozin. The GMR for pioglitazone Cmax,ss when 
      coadministered with empagliflozin versus administration alone was 87.74% (95% CI, 
      73.88%-104.21%) with empagliflozin 10 mg, 90.23% (95% CI, 66.84%-121.82%) with 
      empagliflozin 25 mg, and 89.85% (95% CI, 71.03%-113.66%) with empagliflozin 50 
      mg. The GMR for pioglitazone AUCτ,ss when coadministered with empagliflozin 
      versus administration alone was 90.01% (95% CI, 77.91%-103.99%) with 
      empagliflozin 10 mg, 88.98% (95% CI, 72.69%-108.92%) with empagliflozin 25 mg, 
      and 91.10% (95% CI, 77.40%-107.22%) with empagliflozin 50 mg. The effects of 
      empagliflozin on pioglitazone exposure are not considered to be clinically 
      relevant. Empagliflozin exposure was unaffected by coadministration with 
      pioglitazone. Empagliflozin and pioglitazone were well tolerated when 
      administered alone or in combination. In study 1, adverse events were reported in 
      1 of 19 participants on empagliflozin 50 mg alone, 4 of 20 on pioglitazone alone, 
      and 5 of 18 on combination treatment. In study 2, adverse events were reported in 
      8 of 20 participants on pioglitazone alone, 10 of 18 when coadministered with 
      empagliflozin 10 mg, 5 of 17 when coadministered with empagliflozin 25 mg, and 6 
      of 16 when coadministered with empagliflozin 50 mg. IMPLICATIONS: These results 
      indicate that pioglitazone and empagliflozin can be coadministered without dose 
      adjustments. EudraCT identifiers: 2008-006087-11 (study 1) and 2009-018089-36 
      (study 2).

AB  - AIMS: Empagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      This study assessed pharmacological properties of empagliflozin in vitro and 
      pharmacokinetic properties in vivo and compared its potency and selectivity with 
      other SGLT-2 inhibitors. METHODS: [(14)C]-alpha-methyl glucopyranoside (AMG) 
      uptake experiments were performed with stable cell lines over-expressing human 
      (h) SGLT-1, 2 and 4. Two new cell lines over-expressing hSGLT-5 and hSGLT-6 were 
      established and [(14)C]-mannose and [(14)C]-myo-inositol uptake assays developed. 
      Binding kinetics were analysed using a radioligand binding assay with 
      [(3)H]-labelled empagliflozin and HEK293-hSGLT-2 cell membranes. Acute in vivo 
      assessment of pharmacokinetics was performed with normoglycaemic beagle dogs and 
      Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. RESULTS: Empagliflozin has an IC(50) of 3.1 nM 
      for hSGLT-2. Its binding to SGLT-2 is competitive with glucose (half-life 
      approximately 1 h). Compared with other SGLT-2 inhibitors, empagliflozin has a 
      high degree of selectivity over SGLT-1, 4, 5 and 6. Species differences in SGLT-1 
      selectivity were identified. Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics in ZDF rats were 
      characterised by moderate total plasma clearance (CL) and bioavailability (BA), 
      while in beagle dogs CL was low and BA was high. CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin is a 
      potent and competitive SGLT-2 inhibitor with an excellent selectivity profile and 
      the highest selectivity window of the tested SGLT-2 inhibitors over hSGLT-1. 
      Empagliflozin represents an innovative therapeutic approach to treat diabetes.

AB  - Empagliflozin (Jardiance(®)), a potent, highly selective, sodium glucose 
      cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is an effective and generally well tolerated 
      antihyperglycaemic agent approved for the treatment of adults with type 2 
      diabetes (T2D) in the EU, USA and Japan, among other parts of the world. As with 
      other members of its class, empagliflozin offers the convenience of once-daily 
      oral administration and carries a low inherent risk of hypoglycaemia as a result 
      of its insulin-independent mechanism of action, enabling it to be used as 
      monotherapy and as a component of combination therapy with other antidiabetic 
      agents with complementary modes of action to improve glycaemic control in 
      patients with T2D. Beyond lowering glucose, empagliflozin exerts a favourable 
      effect on a number of nonglycaemic outcomes, including modest reductions in 
      bodyweight and blood pressure. As an adjunct to standard care, it demonstrated 
      cardioprotective and renoprotective properties largely independent of glycaemic 
      control in patients with T2D and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a 
      mandated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial (EMPA-REG OUTCOME). Empagliflozin is 
      generally well tolerated as monotherapy or as add-on therapy and, unlike 
      canagliflozin (the only other SGLT2 inhibitor that has so far shown CV and renal 
      benefits), it has not been associated with an increased risk of amputation or 
      bone fractures. In conclusion, empagliflozin is a valuable treatment option for 
      the management of T2D. Given its demonstrable cardioprotective benefits, the drug 
      is worthy of preferential consideration in patients at high CV risk who require 
      an (additional) antidiabetic medication in order to attain their glycaemic goal.

AB  - Over the past two years, our understanding of anti-hyperglycemic medications used 
      to treat patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has fundamentally changed. Before 
      the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, agents used to lower blood glucose were felt to 
      prevent or delay the development of microvascular complications, but were not 
      known to definitively reduce cardiovascular risk or mortality. Previous studies 
      with then novel sodium-glucose cotransport-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors demonstrated 
      improvements in several cardiovascular and renal risk factors, including HbA1c, 
      blood pressure, weight, renal hyperfiltration, and albuminuria. However, as with 
      other antihyperglycemic drugs, it could not be known if these salutary effects 
      would translate into improved cardiorenal outcomes. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
      trial, SGLT2 inhibition with empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome of major 
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while also reducing mortality, 
      hospitalization for heart failure, and progression of diabetic kidney disease. In 
      the CANVAS Program trials using canagliflozin, the rates of the 3-point MACE 
      endpoint, the risk of heart failure and the renal composite endpoint were also 
      reduced, albeit with an increased risk of lower extremity amputation and 
      fracture. As a result, clinical practice guidelines recommend the consideration 
      of SGLT2 inhibition in high-risk patient subgroups for cardiovascular risk 
      reduction. Ongoing primary renal endpoint trials will inform the 
      cardio-metabolic-renal community about how to optimally treat patients with 
      chronic kidney disease - including those with and without diabetes. Our aim is to 
      review the rationale for renal protection with SGLT2 inhibitors, and their 
      current place in the clinical management of patients with kidney disease.

      Trials.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have a unique 
      mechanism of action leading to excretion of glucose in the urine and subsequent 
      lowering of plasma glucose. This mechanism is independent of β-cell function; 
      thus, these agents are effective treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at 
      theoretically any disease stage. This class should not confer an additional risk 
      of hypoglycemia (unless combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue) and has 
      the potential to be combined with other classes of glucose-lowering agents. 
      Empagliflozin is one of three currently approved SGLT2 inhibitors in the United 
      States, and has shown a favorable benefit-risk ratio in phase 3 clinical trials 
      as monotherapy and as add-on to other glucose-lowering therapy in broad patient 
      populations. In addition to its glucose-lowering effects, empagliflozin has been 
      shown to reduce body weight and blood pressure without a compensatory increase in 
      heart rate. Moreover, on top of standard of care, empagliflozin is the first 
      glucoselowering agent to demonstrate cardiovascular risk reduction in patients at 
      high risk of cardiovascular disease in a prospective outcomes trial: a 14% 
      reduction in risk of the 3-point composite endpoint of death from cardiovascular 
      causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Like other SGLT2 
      inhibitors, empagliflozin is associated with a higher rate of genital mycotic 
      infections than placebo and has the potential for volume depletion-associated 
      events. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the empagliflozin phase 3 clinical 
      trials program and its potential significance in the treatment of patients with 
      T2DM. Evidence from these clinical trials show reductions in glycated hemoglobin 
      (-0.59 to -0.82%) with a low risk of hypoglycemia except when used with insulin 
      or insulin secretagogues, and moderate reductions in body weight (-2.1 to - 2.5 
      kg) and systolic blood pressure (-2.9 to -5.2 mm Hg), thus supporting the use of 
      empagliflozin as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering agents. In 
      addition, evidence from the recent EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, which demonstrated 
      relative risk reductions in major adverse cardiac events (14%), cardiovascular 
      mortality (38%) and all-cause mortality (32%), as well as hospitalization for 
      heart failure (36%), supports use of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM and 
      increased cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of a generic empagliflozin tablet versus a 
      brand-named product and the food effects in healthy Chinese subjects.
PG  - 1487-1494
LID - 10.1080/03639045.2020.1810263 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the bioequivalence of a 
      generic empagliflozin tablet versus a brand-named empagliflozin tablet 
      (Jardiance(®)) and evaluate the food effects on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      empagliflozin in healthy Chinese subjects. METHODS: Forty-eight healthy 
      volunteers were included in this randomized, open-label, crossover, two-period 
      study (fasting: n = 24, fed: n = 24). A single dose of 25-mg generic (or test) or 
      brand-named (or reference) empagliflozin was administered to each subject in a 
      randomized sequence. Blood samples were collected at the baseline and during the 
      72 h post-dose, and plasma empagliflozin concentrations were determined by high 
      performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed with non-compartmental methods. Safety 
      was monitored. RESULTS: The major PK parameters including C (max), AUC(0-) (t) , 
      and AUC(0-∞) were similar between the generic and brand-named tablets under 
      fasting and fed conditions (all p > .05). The 90% confidence intervals of the 
      test/reference ratios of log-transformed C (max), AUC(0-) (t) , and AUC(0-∞) were 
      94.90-106.70%, 100.62-106.99%, and 100.64-106.85%, respectively, under fasting 
      condition, and 94.21-104.91%, 97.31-101.79%, and 97.32-101.83%, respectively, 
      under fed condition. High-fat food did not affect C (max), AUC(0-) (t) , 
      AUC(0-∞), or T (max) of empagliflozin (all p > .05). There was no serious adverse 
      event during the study period. CONCLUSION: The generic formulation of 
      empagliflozin tablet is bioequivalent to the brand-named product in healthy 
      Chinese volunteers, and well tolerated. High-fat food had no effects on the PK of 
      empagliflozin in healthy Chinese volunteers.

      after Single Oral Administration under Fasting and Fed Conditions in Healthy 
      Chinese Subjects: An Open-label Randomized Single-dose Two-sequence, 
      Two-treatment, Two-period Crossover Study.
PG  - 623-631

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of 
      empagliflozin, and the bioequivalence of test formulation empagliflozin tablet 
      compared with the brand-name drug Jardiance (reference formulation) after single 
      oral administration under fasting and fed conditions in healthy Chinese subjects. 
      METHODS: An open-label randomized single-dose two-sequence, two-treatment, 
      two-period crossover study was conducted in healthy Chinese subjects, with 30 
      subjects under fasting condition and another 30 subjects under fed condition. 
      Under each condition, subjects received a single oral administration of either 
      the test or reference empagliflozin formulation, and then they received a single 
      oral dose of the other formulation after a 7-day washout period. RESULTS: A total 
      of 29 subjects under each condition completed the study. The maximum plasma drug 
      concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 
      t (AUC(0-t) ), and the AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-∞) ) of test formulation and 
      reference formulation was 186.90 ± 47.21 and 190.60 ± 40.94 ng/ml, 
      1303.04 ± 234.28 and 1267.78 ± 217.07 ng·hour/ml, and 1328.08 ± 243.84 and 
      1293.22 ± 224.82 ng·hour/ml under fasting condition, and 151.55 ± 23.86 and 
      154.08 ± 30.40 ng/ml, 1215.65 ± 197.62 and 1199.26 ± 186.23 ng·hour/ml, and 
      1241.76 ± 202.47 and 1225.54 ± 192.10 ng·hour/ml under fed condition, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The two formulations of empagliflozin were 
      bioequivalent, and both were generally well tolerated under fasting and fed 
      conditions.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response (Efficacy and

PG  - 455-71
LID - 10.1007/s13300-016-0174-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the analysis was to characterize the population 
      pharmacokinetics (PKs) and exposure-response (E-R) for efficacy (fasting plasma 
      glucose, glycated hemoglobin) and safety/tolerability [hypoglycemia, genital 
      infections, urinary tract infection (UTI), and volume depletion] of the sodium 
      glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. This study extends the findings of previous analyses which 
      described the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) using early clinical studies of up to 
      12 weeks in duration. METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic and E-R models were 
      developed based on two Phase I, four Phase II, and four Phase III studies. 
      RESULTS: Variability in empagliflozin exposure was primarily affected by 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (less than twofold increase in 
      exposure in patients with severe renal impairment). Consistent with its mode of 
      action, the efficacy of empagliflozin was increased with elevated baseline plasma 
      glucose levels and attenuated with decreasing renal function, but was still 
      maintained to nearly half the maximal effect with eGFR as low as 
      30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). All other investigated covariates, including sex, body mass 
      index, race, and age did not alter the PK or efficacy of empagliflozin to a 
      clinically relevant extent. Compared with placebo, empagliflozin administration 
      was associated with an exposure-independent increase in the incidence of genital 
      infections and no significant change in the risk of UTI, hypoglycemia, or volume 
      depletion. CONCLUSION: Based on the results from the PK and E-R analysis, no dose 
      adjustment is required for empagliflozin in the patient population for which the 
      drug is approved. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.

PG  - 1125-1132
LID - 10.1093/jpp/rgac022 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the effect of Acai berry on the pharmacokinetics of 
      Atorvastatin (ATR), Alogliptin (ALO) and Empagliflozin (EMPA) in SD rats. METHOD: 
      Thirty-six rats were divided into six groups (n = 6). First three groups were 
      treated with Acai berry (PO; 250 mg/kg); fourth, fifth and sixth groups received 
      sodium CMC (vehicle) for 10 days and on eleventh day, first and fourth groups 
      were administered with ATR (PO; 10 mg/kg); second and fifth groups with ALO (PO; 
      25 mg/kg) and third and sixth groups received EMPA (PO; 25 mg/kg). KEY FINDINGS: 
      Co-intake of ATR with Acai berry resulted in slight decrease in Cmax from 41.78 
      to 34.65 ng/ml and AUC from 227.66 to 136.31 (µg/ml) *h, while there was an 
      increase in the Cmax from 43.43 to 68.71 ng/ml and AUC from 117.6 to 207.1 
      (µg/ml) *h in ALO treated groups and Cmax from 173.99 to 250.1 ng/ml and AUC from 
      400.37 to 518.35 (µg/ml) *h in the EMPA-treated groups. CONCLUSION: There was a 
      significant change in the AUC0-t and Cmax of ATR, ALO and EMPA after 
      co-administration with Acai berry. Further studies are recommended to confirm the 
      clinical significance of these interactions.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic properties of empagliflozin 5 mg twice daily (BID) and 10 mg 
      once daily (QD) in healthy subjects. METHODS: In an open-label, 2-way crossover 
      study, subjects (n = 16) received empagliflozin 5 mg BID for 5 days and 
      empagliflozin 10 mg QD for 5 days in a randomized order, with a washout period of 
      ≥6 days between each treatment. The primary objective was the comparison of the 
      overall exposure during a 24-hour period at steady state (AUC0-24,ss) for 
      empagliflozin, based on standard bioequivalence criteria, with BID and QD dose 
      regimens. FINDINGS: The study population comprised 7 (43.8%) men and 9 (56.3%) 
      women with a baseline median age of 38.0 years (range, 23-47 years) and a median 
      body mass index of 23.3 kg/m(2) (range, 19.8-27.8 kg/m(2)). Based on standard 
      bioequivalence criteria, there was no difference in the overall exposure of 
      empagliflozin between BID and QD dose regimens (geometric mean ratio of 
      AUC0-24,ss for empagliflozin 5 mg BID compared with empagliflozin 10 mg QD = 
      99.36%; 90% CI, 94.29-104.71). For empagliflozin 10 mg QD, mean (%CV) AUC during 
      the dosing interval was 1900 nmol · h/L (20.6%), mean (%CV) Cmax,ss was 330 
      nmol/L (25.3%), and median (range) Tmax,ss was 1.0 hour (0.7-2.0 hours). For 
      empagliflozin 5 mg BID, mean (%CV) AUC during the dosing interval was 1010 nmol · 
      h/L (15.1%) and 867 nmol · h/L (18.6%) after the morning and evening dose, 
      respectively, mean (%CV) Cmax,ss was 193 nmol/L (16.5%) and 120 nmol/L (21.0%), 
      respectively, and median Tmax,ss was 1.0 hour (range, 0.7-2.0 hours) and 2.0 
      hours (range, 1.0-4.0 hours), respectively. The mean (%CV) cumulative amount of 
      glucose excreted in urine during 24 hours was 52.1 g (32.1%) with empagliflozin 5 
      mg BID and 43.9 g (30.3%) with empagliflozin 10 mg QD. Adverse events were 
      reported in six subjects (37.5%) receiving empagliflozin 5 mg BID and four 
      (25.0%) receiving empagliflozin 10 mg QD. Headache was the most frequent AE. No 
      severe, serious, or drug-related AEs were reported. IMPLICATIONS: There were no 
      clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties 
      between BID and QD dose regimens of empagliflozin in healthy subjects. Both dose 
      regimens were well tolerated. EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT) number:

      pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 117-130
LID - 10.1177/1469066719879297 [doi]
AB  - A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was 
      developed, optimized, and validated for simultaneous quantification of 
      empagliflozin and metformin in human plasma using empagliflozin D4and metformin 
      D6 as an internal standard. Analytes and internal standard were extracted from 
      plasma by optimized solid-phase extraction technique using Strata X polymeric 
      reverse phase (30 mg-1cc) solid-phase extraction cartridges. The prepared samples 
      were chromatographed on Orosil C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 3 µ). Separation was 
      done by pumping isocratic mobile phase consisting of methanol and 10 mM ammonium 
      trifluoroacetate (90:10, v/v) in positive ion mode at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. 
      The API 3200 liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system having turbo ion 
      spray as an ion source coupled with Shimadzu Prominence ultrafast liquid 
      chromatography system was operated under the selected reaction monitoring mode. 
      Turbo ion spray ionization was used for mass transition of m/z 468.070/355.100 
      and m/z 130.072/71.200 for empagliflozin and metformin, respectively. A method 
      was successfully validated for concentration range of 10.09-5013.46 ng/mL for 
      both the analytes and according to the United States Food and Drugs 
      Administration guidelines. The linearity was found to be in the range of 
      10.09-403.46 ng/mL for empagliflozin and 25.44-5013.46 ng/mL for metformin. The 
      limit of quantification was found to be 10.09 ng/mL for empagliflozin and 
      25.44 ng/mL for metformin. Intra- and inter-day/between batch precision 
      determination for empagliflozin and metformin, expressed as coefficient of 
      variation were within the acceptance limits and ranged below 13.16%. A short run 
      time of 3.3 min allows analysis of more than 400 plasma samples per day. The 
      developed method was successfully applied to fasting pharmacokinetic study in 
      healthy human volunteers. Results of incurred sample re-analysis were within the 
      acceptance range of ±20% of original value, for 97.2% of samples reanalyzed for 
      empagliflozin and 100% of samples reanalyzed for metformin.

AB  - Background: Empagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor approved for use in patients with 
      diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) with or without other cardiovascular disease. 
      Empagliflozin is taken once daily without rationale on the optimal timing for 
      administration. This study aimed to determine the chronopharmacological effects 
      of morning vs evening administration of empagliflozin (10 mg) in healthy Egyptian 
      adults, by investigating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters of 
      empagliflozin depending on the intake time. Methods: An open label, sequential, 
      two-way crossover trial comprised of two periods with a washout period of 7 days. 
      All participants received a single oral dose of empagliflozin (JARDIANCE ®; 10 mg 
      film coated tablet) in the evening, and after a seven-day washout period, the 
      morning. Pharmacokinetics parameters (primary endpoints: t (max) (h), C (max) 
      (ng/ml), AUC (0-t) (ng.h/ml); secondary endpoints: AUC (0 to ∞)(ng.h/ml)) were 
      assessed. Method validation was done prior to injection in LC/MS/MS and samples 
      were processed by Liquid-Liquid extraction. The pharmacodynamic profile (UGE 
      (0-24)) was determined after method validation (glucose hexokinase method). 
      Results: T (max) increased by 35% in the evening phase compared to the morning 
      phase, while C (max) decreased by -6.5% in the evening dose compared to the 
      morning dose. Additionally, AUC (0 to ∞) increased in the evening phase by 8.25% 
      compared to the morning phase. The mean cumulative amount of glucose excreted 
      (UGE ( (0-24))) increased by 43% in the evening dose compared to the morning dose 
      Conclusion: Despite the difference in pharmacokinetics parameters between evening 
      and morning doses, C (max), AUC (0-t), AUC (0-∞), didn't differ on the 
      bioequivalence level. In addition, as UGE ( (0-24)) didn't statistically differ, 
      thus, we can conclude that there is no statistical significance between the 
      morning and evening doses. Trial registration: Clinal Trials.gov, ID: NCT03895229

TI  - Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin in Paediatric Indications: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 229-243

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In adults, sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors have 
      revolutionised the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and 
      chronic kidney disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review information on 
      compassionate use, clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of dapagliflozin 
      and empagliflozin in children. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of 
      published clinical trials, case reports, and observational studies in Medline, 
      Excerpta Medica, and Web of Science databases from inception to September 2023. 
      For the two randomised controlled trials on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we 
      implemented a meta-analysis on the primary outcome (mean difference in 
      glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c] between intervention and placebo groups). Review 
      Manager (RevMan), version 5.4.1, was used for this purpose. RESULTS: Thirty-five 
      articles (nine case reports, ten case series, one prospective non-controlled 
      trial, four controlled randomised trials, two surveys, six pharmacokinetic 
      studies, and three pharmacovigilance studies) were selected, in which 415 
      children were exposed to either dapagliflozin or empagliflozin: 189 diabetic 
      patients (mean age 14.7 ± 2.9 years), 32 children with glycogen storage disease 
      type Ib (GSD Ib), glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3 (G6PC3) deficiency, 
      or severe congenital neutropenia type 4 (8.5 ± 5.1 years), 47 children with 
      kidney disease or heart failure (11.2 ± 6.1 years), 84 patients in 
      pharmacokinetic studies (15.1 ± 2.3 years), and 63 patients in toxicological 
      series. The effect of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in T2DM was demonstrated by 
      HbA1c reduction in two randomised trials among a total of 177 adolescents, with a 
      mean HbA1c difference of -0.82% (95% confidence interval -1.34 to -0.29) as 
      compared to placebo (no heterogeneity, I(2) = 0%). Dosage ranged between 5 and 
      20 mg (mean 11.4 ± 3.7) once daily for dapagliflozin and between 5 and 25 mg 
      (mean 15.4 ± 7.4) once daily for empagliflozin. Among the paediatric cases of GSD 
      Ib, empagliflozin 0.1-1.3 mg/kg/day improved neutropenia, infections, and 
      gastrointestinal health. Dapagliflozin (mean dosage 6.9 ± 5.2 mg once daily) was 
      well-tolerated in children with chronic kidney disease and heart failure. Side 
      effects were generally mild, the most frequent being hypoglycaemia in children 
      with GSD Ib (33% of patients) or T2DM (14% of patients) on concomitant 
      hypoglycaemic drugs. Diabetic ketoacidosis is rare in children. CONCLUSION: Early 
      evidence suggests that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are well tolerated in 
      children. A clinical pharmacology rationale currently exists only for adolescents 
      with diabetes mellitus. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42023438162.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors such as 
      Empagliflozin are novel antihyperglycemic drugs approved for the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes (T2D). In addition to its glucose-lowering effects, Empagliflozin 
      promotes weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and other beneficial metabolic 
      benefits. AREAS COVERED: This review outlines the pharmacokinetics, 
      pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of Empagliflozin and discusses its 
      role in diabetes-associated hypertension. EXPERT OPINION: Empagliflozin was the 
      first in class to not only demonstrate safety of SGLT2 inhibition but also 
      cardio- and reno-protective effects in an adequately powered cardiovascular 
      outcome trial. The EMPA-REG study showed significant reductions in mortality from 
      cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, and progression of 
      diabetic kidney disease. These benefits cannot be attributed to glycemic control 
      alone, suggesting the involvement of other SGLT2 inhibition-mediated mechanisms. 
      Recent data suggests the potential utility of SGLT2 inhibition in other 
      conditions including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and non-diabetic heart failure 
      patients with clinical trials currently being conducted. In concert with ongoing 
      pre-clinical investigations to unravel the mechanisms contributing to cardiorenal 
      protection, the full therapeutic potential of SGLT2 inhibition will become 
      apparent over the next few years and promises to be one of the major success 
      stories in clinical medicine. ABBREVIATIONS: T1D: type 1 diabetes; T2D: type 2

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to investigate potential drugdrug 
      interactions between the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin 
      and simvastatin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, randomized crossover 
      trial, healthy volunteers (median (range) age 36.5 (20 - 50) years) received 3 
      single-dose treatments: 25 mg empagliflozin (n = 18), 40 mg simvastatin (n = 17), 
      and 25 mg empagliflozin with 40 mg simvastatin (n = 18). RESULTS: Based on 
      standard criteria, simvastatin had no effect on empagliflozin area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-∞), adjusted geometric mean ratio (GMR): 
      102.05; 90% CI: 98.90 - 105.29) or maximum plasma concentration (C(max), GMR: 
      109.49; 90% CI: 96.91 - 123.69). There were only minor deviations in simvastatin 
      AUC(0-∞) (GMR: 101.26; 90% CI: 80.06 - 128.07) and C(max) (GMR: 97.18; 90% CI: 
      76.30 - 123.77) when co-administered with empagliflozin. Empagliflozin had no 
      effect on AUC(0-∞) (GMR: 104.87; 90% CI: 90.09 - 122.07) or C(max) (GMR: 97.27; 
      90% CI: 84.90 - 111.44) of simvastatin acid, the active metabolite of 
      simvastatin. Adverse events (AEs) were reported for 6 subjects on empagliflozin, 
      4 on simvastatin, and 5 on co-administered treatment. No serious AEs or 
      investigator-defined drug-related AEs were reported. CONCLUSION: No relevant 
      drug-drug interaction was observed, and pharmacokinetic results suggest that no 
      dose adjustments for either drug are necessary when empagliflozin and simvastatin 
      are co-administered. Empagliflozin was well tolerated when administered alone or 
      in combination with simvastatin.

AB  - AIMS: Empagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitor that inhibits renal glucose reabsorption and is being investigated for 
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In this open-label 
      study, the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics 
      and safety of a 50 mg dose of empagliflozin was investigated in 40 subjects, 
      grouped according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: 
      Maximum empagliflozin plasma concentrations were similar in subjects with normal 
      renal function and renal impairment. Area under the empagliflozin 
      concentration-time curve (AUC0 -∞ ) values increased by approximately 18, 20, 66 
      and 48% in subjects with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and renal 
      failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD), respectively, in comparison to healthy 
      subjects. This was attributed to decreased renal clearance (CLR ). Urinary 
      glucose excretion (UGE) decreased with increasing renal impairment and correlated 
      with decreased eGFR and CLR . Empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increase 
      in adverse events associated with renal impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Renal 
      insufficiency resulted in decreased CLR of empagliflozin, moderately increased 
      systemic exposure and decreased UGE. A single 50 mg dose of empagliflozin was 
      well tolerated in subjects with normal renal function and any degree of renal 
      impairment. The pharmacokinetic results of this study indicate that no dose 
      adjustment of empagliflozin is required in patients with renal impairment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This open-label study investigated potential drug-drug interactions 
      between empagliflozin and metformin. METHODS: 16 healthy men received treatment A 
      (empagliflozin 50 mg q.d. for 5 days), treatment B (empagliflozin 50 mg q.d. for 
      4 days with metformin 1,000 mg b.i.d. for 3 days and 1,000 mg q.d. on Day 4) and 
      treatment C (metformin 1,000 mg b.i.d. for 3 days and 1,000 mg q.d .on Day 4) in 
      the sequence AB then C, or C then AB. RESULTS: Metformin had no clinically 
      relevant effect on the area under the steady state plasma concentration-time 
      curve (AUC(τ,ss) geometric mean ratio (GMR): 96.9; 90% CI: 92.3 - 101.7) or the 
      maximum plasma concentration at steady state (C(max,ss) GMR: 100.5; 90% CI: 88.8 
      - 113.7) of empagliflozin. Similarly, empagliflozin had no clinically relevant 
      effect on AUC(τ,ss) (GMR: 100.7; 90% CI: 95.9 - 105.6) or C(max,ss) (GMR: 103.6; 
      90% CI: 96.5 - 111.2) of metformin. The renal clearance of empagliflozin and 
      metformin were unaffected by co-administration. Both drugs were well tolerated 
      alone and in combination and did not cause hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      support co-administration of empagliflozin and metformin without dose adjustment.

TI  - Effect of empagliflozin on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol 
      and levonorgestrel in healthy female volunteers.
PG  - 351-7
LID - 10.1007/s40261-013-0068-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is a potent, selective inhibitor of sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 in development for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Oral contraceptives may be co-administered with antidiabetic agents 
      over long periods of time, therefore potential drug-drug interactions between 
      oral contraceptives and antidiabetic drugs should be investigated. OBJECTIVE: The 
      effect of multiple oral doses of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily (qd) on the 
      steady-state pharmacokinetics of the combined oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol 
      (EE) 30 μg/levonorgestrel (LNG) 150 μg qd was investigated. STUDY DESIGN: This 
      was a phase I, open-label, two-period, fixed sequence study. SETTING: The study 
      was performed at the Human Pharmacology Centre/Department of Translational 
      Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim, Biberach, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen healthy 
      premenopausal women participated in the study. INTERVENTION: There was a 
      mandatory run-in period in which participants received EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg qd for 
      21-48 days followed by a treatment-free interval of 7 days. Participants then 
      received EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg qd for 14 days (reference; period 1), followed by EE 
      30 μg/LNG 150 μg qd plus empagliflozin 25 mg qd for 7 days (test; period 2). MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG at steady state based on the 
      primary endpoints of area under the steady-state plasma concentration-time curve 
      during a dosage interval τ (AUC(τ,ss)) and maximum steady-state plasma 
      concentration during a dosage interval (C (max,ss)) were the main outcome 
      measures. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG were not affected by 
      co-administration with empagliflozin. Geometric mean ratios (90 % CI) of 
      AUC(τ,ss) and C (max,ss) for EE were 102.82 % (97.58, 108.35) and 99.22 % (93.40, 
      105.39), respectively. For LNG, these values were 101.94 % (98.54, 105.47) and 
      105.81 % (99.47, 112.55), respectively. The 90 % CIs were within the standard 
      bioequivalence boundaries of 80-125 %. There were no relevant changes in the time 
      to reach peak levels (t (max,ss)) or terminal elimination half-life (t (½,ss)) of 
      EE and LNG between test and reference treatments. Ten women in each treatment had 
      at least one adverse event (AE). Severe AEs were reported by three women in the 
      reference period and one woman in the test period. There were no serious AEs or 
      premature discontinuations. CONCLUSION: The combination of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg 
      and empagliflozin 25 mg was well tolerated. Based on standard bioequivalence 
      criteria, empagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG, 
      indicating that no dose adjustment of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg is required when 
      empagliflozin is co-administered.

LID - 10.1007/s13300-013-0030-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and 
      pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin, a potent and highly selective sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). METHODS: A total of 48 patients with T2DM were randomized to receive one 
      of four doses of empagliflozin (2.5, 10, 25, or 100 mg qd) or placebo over 
      8 days. In every dose group, nine patients received active drug and three 
      received placebo. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. 
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were measured as secondary 
      endpoints. RESULTS: Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, reaching peak levels 
      1.5-3.0 h after dosing and showed a biphasic decline. The mean terminal 
      elimination half-life ranged from 10 to 19 h. Increases in exposure (area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] and maximum concentration of analyte in 
      plasma [C max]) were approximately proportional with dose. Empagliflozin 
      increased the rate and total amount of glucose excreted in urine compared to 
      placebo. After administration of a single dose of empagliflozin, cumulative 
      amounts of glucose excreted in urine over 24 h ranged from 46.3 to 89.8 g, 
      compared with 5.84 g with placebo. Similar results were seen after multiple 
      doses. Fasting plasma glucose levels decreased by 17.2-25.8% with empagliflozin 
      and by 12.7% with placebo. The frequency of adverse events was 33.3-66.7% with 
      empagliflozin and 41.7% with placebo. There were no changes in urine volume or 
      micturition frequency under the controlled study conditions. CONCLUSION: Overall, 
      pharmacokinetic assessments demonstrated a dose-proportional increase in drug 
      exposure and support once-daily dosing. Elevated urinary glucose excretion was 
      observed with all doses. Multiple once-daily oral doses of empagliflozin 
      (2.5-100 mg) reduced plasma glucose and were well tolerated in patients with 
      T2DM. EudraCT (2007-000654-32).

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in patients with hepatic impairment.
PG  - 118-23
LID - 10.1111/dom.12183 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This open-label, parallel-group study investigated the effect of various 
      degrees of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of 
      the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin. METHODS: Thirty-six 
      subjects [8 each with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
      classification), and 12 matched controls with normal hepatic function] received a 
      single 50 mg dose of empagliflozin. RESULTS: Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed. 
      After reaching peak levels, plasma drug concentrations declined in a biphasic 
      fashion. Compared with subjects with normal hepatic function, geometric mean 
      ratios (90% confidence interval) of AUC(0-∞) and C(max) were 123.15% 
      (98.89-153.36) and 103.81% (82.29-130.95), respectively, in patients with mild 
      hepatic impairment, 146.97% (118.02-183.02) and 123.31% (97.74-155.55), 
      respectively, in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, and 174.70% 
      (140.29-217.55) and 148.41% (117.65-187.23), respectively, in patients with 
      severe hepatic impairment. Adverse events, all mild or moderate in intensity, 
      were reported in three subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, two subjects 
      with severe hepatic impairment and six subjects with normal hepatic function. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin was well tolerated in subjects with hepatic 
      impairment. Increases in empagliflozin exposure were less than twofold in 
      patients with hepatic impairment; therefore no dose adjustment of empagliflozin 
      is required in patients with hepatic impairment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety and 
      tolerability of empagliflozin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 4-week, multiple dose, randomized, parallel-group, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients (n = 100) were randomized to 
      receive 1, 5, 10 or 25 mg of empagliflozin, or placebo once daily. Key end-points 
      were urinary glucose excretion (UGE), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 
      eight-point glucose profile. RESULTS: Data are presented for 1, 5, 10, 25 mg of 
      empagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Adjusted mean changes from 
      baseline to day 27 in UGE were 40.8, 77.1, 80.9, 93.0 and -2.1 g (P < 0.0001 for 
      all empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day 
      28 in FPG were -1.56, -1.96, -2.31, -2.37 and -0.86 mmol/L (P < 0.01 for all 
      empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day 27 
      in eight-point glucose profile were -1.96, -2.21, -2.42, -2.54 and -0.97 mmol/L 
      (P < 0.01 for all empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Empagliflozin reached peak 
      plasma concentration 1.5-2 h after dosing. Mean steady state terminal elimination 
      half-lives ranged from 13.2 to 18.0 h. Of 100 patients, 25 experienced an adverse 
      event, occurring more frequently for empagliflozin (29.1%) than placebo (9.5%); 
      frequency was not dose related. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus, empagliflozin at doses up to 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks was 
      well tolerated and resulted in significant improvements in glycemic control 
      compared with placebo. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no. 
      NCT00885118).

AB  - With rates of obesity and diabetes rising across the world, effective therapies 
      to treat hyperglycemia and its associated comorbidities continue to be in demand. 
      Empagliflozin is a highly selective sodium glucose transporter-2 inhibitor that 
      improves serum glucose levels by inducing glucosuria. Taken orally, it is rapidly 
      absorbed with linear pharmacokinetics consistent in Asian and Caucasian 
      populations. Empagliflozin treatment demonstrates consistent reductions in 
      hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and blood pressure in 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes. Improvements in glycemic control and metabolic 
      end points are evident with empagliflozin monotherapy, as add-on to oral 
      hypoglycemics or add-on to insulin. The nonglycemic effects of empagliflozin with 
      consistent improvements in blood pressure, body weight, and waist circumference 
      provide additional rationale for use in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, 
      treatment with empagliflozin has recently shown significant reductions in both 
      microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes.

TI  - Mechanistic Modeling of Empagliflozin: Predicting Pharmacokinetics, Urinary 
      Glucose Excretion, and Investigating Compensatory Role of SGLT1 in Renal Glucose 
      Reabsorption.
PG  - 672-684
LID - 10.1002/jcph.2413 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to use a combination of physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and urinary glucose excretion (UGE) modeling to 
      predict the time profiles of pharmacokinetics (PK) and UGE for the sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin (EMP). Additionally, the study 
      aims to explore the compensatory effect of SGLT1 in renal glucose reabsorption 
      (RGR) when SGLT2 is inhibited. The PBPK-UGE model was developed using 
      physicochemical and biochemical properties, renal physiological parameters, 
      binding kinetics, glucose, and Na(+) reabsorption kinetics by SGLT1/2. For area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve, maximum plasma concentration, and 
      cumulative EMP excretion in urine, the predicted values fell within a range of 
      0.5-2.0 when compared to observed data. Additionally, the simulated UGE data also 
      matched well with the clinical data, further validating the accuracy of the 
      model. According to the simulations, SGLT1 and SGLT2 contributed approximately 
      13% and 87%, respectively, to RGR in the absence of EMP. However, in the presence 
      of EMP at doses of 2.5 and 10 mg, the contribution of SGLT1 to RGR significantly 
      increased to approximately 76%-82% and 89%-93%, respectively, in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the model supported the understanding that 
      the compensatory effect of SGLT1 is the underlying mechanism behind the moderate 
      inhibition observed in total RGR. The PBPK-UGE model has the capability to 
      accurately predict the PK and UGE time profiles in humans. Furthermore, it 
      provides a comprehensive analysis of the specific contributions of SGLT1 and 
      SGLT2 to RGR in the presence or absence of EMP.

      Japanese subjects.
PG  - 213-9
AB  - This randomized, placebo-controlled within dose groups, double-blind, single 
      rising dose study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of 1 mg to 100 mg doses of empagliflozin in 48 healthy Japanese 
      male subjects. Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, reaching peak levels in 1.25 
      to 2.50 h; thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic fashion, with 
      mean terminal elimination half-life ranging from 7.76 to 11.7 h. Increase in 
      empagliflozin exposure was proportional to dose. Oral clearance was dose 
      independent and ranged from 140 to 172 mL/min. In the 24 h following 100 mg 
      empagliflozin administration, the mean (%CV) amount of glucose excreted in urine 
      was 74.3 (17.1) g. The amount and the maximum rate of glucose excreted via urine 
      increased with dose of empagliflozin. Nine adverse events, all of mild intensity, 
      were reported by 8 subjects (7 with empagliflozin and 1 with the placebo). No 
      hypoglycemia was reported. In conclusion, 1 mg to 100 mg doses of empagliflozin 
      had a good safety and tolerability profile in healthy Japanese male subjects. 
      Exposure to empagliflozin was dose proportional. The amount and rate of urinary 
      glucose excretion were higher with empagliflozin than with the placebo, and 
      increased with empagliflozin dose.

LID - 10.1111/dom.12073 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes following oral 
      administration of 10, 25 or 100 mg doses once daily over 28 days. METHODS: A 
      total of 78 patients were assigned to empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 16), 25 mg 
      (n = 16) or 100 mg (n = 30) or placebo (n = 16) for 28 days. Assessments included 
      adverse events (AEs) and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints. RESULTS: 
      Empagliflozin exposure increased dose-proportionally over the dose range 10-100 
      mg and showed linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. Urinary glucose 
      excretion (UGE) increased from baseline to day 1 by 74, 90 and 81 g with 
      empagliflozin 10, 25 and 100 mg, respectively. The increases in UGE were 
      maintained over 28 days with multiple dosing. Virtually no change in UGE was 
      observed in the placebo group. Significant reductions from baseline in mean daily 
      plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose were observed with empagliflozin 
      compared with placebo. The incidence of AEs was similar in the empagliflozin and 
      placebo groups (50.0, 56.3 and 66.7% with empagliflozin rising doses and 62.5% 
      with placebo). The most frequently reported AEs were pollakiuria (10.3%), 
      nasopharyngitis (9.0%), constipation (9.0%) and headache (7.7%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Oral administration of empagliflozin at doses of 10, 25 or 100 mg once daily over 
      28 days resulted in significant increases in UGE and reductions in blood glucose 
      compared with placebo, and were well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin at different doses in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus: A network meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 270-286
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13521 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: As an oral hypoglycaemic drug that significantly 
      reduces cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin is often used in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the dosage and administration of empagliflozin 
      are still controversial clinically. To determine the most appropriate dose, we 
      performed this network meta-analysis. METHODS: We identified randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) about empagliflozin from eight databases. We analysed 
      the pharmacodynamics, adverse effects (AEs), and pharmacokinetics of 
      empagliflozin at different doses. RESULTS: We identified 8264 articles, of which 
      23 RCTs with 10518 patients were included. Regarding haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and 
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG), high-daily doses (10, 25, 50 mg) were significantly 
      better than low doses (1, 2.5, 5 mg). For total AEs, there was a dose-response 
      trend in which safety decreased with increasing doses. According to SUCRA 
      sequencing, the order for lowering HbA1c was 25 > 50 > 10 > 5 > 1 mg, for 
      lowering FPG was 50 > 25 > 10 > 5 > 2.5 > 1 mg and for safety was 1> 5 > 10 > 25> 
      2.5 > 50 mg. When considering HbA1c, FPG and total AEs, we performed a 
      hierarchical cluster analysis and network meta-analysis to find that 25 mg 
      performed best among different doses, which was more significant after long-term 
      use (≥ 12 weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters exhibited significant dose-response 
      relationships. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: High-daily doses (10, 25, 50 mg) had 
      better efficacy than low doses (1, 2.5, 5 mg). When considering HbA1c, FPG and 
      total AEs, 25 mg performed best among the different doses in patients with T2DM.

TI  - Effects of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on 6-min walk distance in heart 
      failure with preserved and reduced ejection fraction: A systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials involving 2624 patients.
PG  - 951-963
LID - 10.1007/s00228-024-03660-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are antidiabetic medications. They 
      are the first two sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) to receive 
      the US Food and Drug Administration approval to manage heart failure. Emerging 
      new trials have examined changes in the 6-min walk distance as a clinically 
      significant response to dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients with heart 
      failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with preserved 
      ejection fraction (HFrEF). This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on the 6-min walk distance in patients with HFpEF 
      and HFrEF. To our knowledge, no such meta-analysis has been published. METHODS: 
      Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we searched four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, 
      Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) to identify eligible studies reported up to 
      December 16, 2023. Using Review Manager software, we reported outcomes as risk 
      ratios (RRs) or mean difference (MD) and confidence intervals (CIs). A 
      p-value ≤ 0.05 is considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The 
      meta-analysis included a total of 8 studies with 2624 patients. Overall, the 
      results showed insignificant differences in the 6-min walk between the SGLT2i and 
      placebo (MD 24, 95% CI -0.30 to 18.78, p = 0.06). Results became significant 
      after resolving the heterogeneity (MD 6.72, 95% CI 0.13 to 13.31, p = 0.05). 
      Notably, the results of each drug separately were insignificant. More robust 
      observations occurred in the HFpEF group (MD 10.73, 95% CI 1.08 to 20.39, 
      p = 0.03). Compared to placebo, patients on dapagliflozin reported significant 
      improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary 
      (KCCQ-CS) and Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) with values of MD 5.18 (95% CI 2.80 to 
      7.57, p < 0.0001) and MD 4.06 (95% CI 1.66 to 6.46, p = 0.0009), respectively. 
      The dapagliflozin group and patients with HFpEF had reported a significant 
      reduction in their weight compared with the control group (MD -0.59 CI -1.09 to 
      -0.08, p = 0.02) and (MD -0.80 CI -1.47 to -0.13, p = 0.02), respectively. No 
      significant side effects were observed for dapagliflozin or empagliflozin. 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with HFpEF experienced benefits from SGLT2i administration, 
      as evidenced by improved 6-min walk distances and weight reduction. Dapagliflozin 
      demonstrated clinical and overall improvements in KCCQ scores and was more 
      effective in reducing weight than the placebo. Both Dapagliflozin and 
      Empagliflozin were well-tolerated and exhibited favorable safety profiles. Future 
      studies could benefit from a larger patient population, a longer follow-up 
      period, and a broader range of SGLT2i.

TI  - Evaluation of pharmacokinetic interactions between lobeglitazone, empagliflozin, 
      and metformin in healthy subjects.

AB  - Concomitant administration of lobeglitazone, empagliflozin, and metformin is 
      expected to enhance blood glucose-lowering effects and improve medication 
      compliance in patients with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we investigated the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions and safety of lobeglitazone and co-administered 
      empagliflozin and metformin, which are approved agents used in clinical settings. 
      Two randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence 
      crossover clinical trials (parts 1 and 2) were conducted independently. In part 
      1, lobeglitazone monotherapy or lobeglitazone, empagliflozin, and metformin 
      triple therapy was administered for 5 days. In part 2, empagliflozin and 
      metformin dual therapy or the abovementioned triple therapy were administered for 
      5 days. Serial blood samples were collected up to 24 hours after the last dose in 
      each period for PK evaluation. The primary PK parameters (AUC(tau,ss), C(max,ss)) 
      of treatment regimens in each study part were calculated and compared. For 
      lobeglitazone, the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 90% confidence intervals 
      (CI) for triple therapy over monotherapy were 1.08 (1.03-1.14) for C(max,ss) and 
      0.98 (0.90-1.07) for AUC(tau,ss). For empagliflozin, the GMRs and 90% CIs for 
      triple therapy over dual therapy were 0.87 (0.78-0.97) for C(max,ss) and 0.97 
      (0.93-1.00) for AUC(tau,ss). For metformin, the GMRs and 90% CIs for triple 
      therapy over dual therapy were 1.06 (0.95-1.17) for C(max,ss) and 1.04 
      (0.97-1.12) for AUC(tau,ss). All reported adverse events were mild. The triple 
      therapy consisting of lobeglitazone, empagliflozin, and metformin did not show 
      any clinically relevant drug interactions in relation to the PKs and safety of 
      each drug substance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

AB  - Empagliflozin and metformin are oral antidiabetic drugs commonly used to treat 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus as a combination therapy. This study aimed to compare 
      the pharmacokinetics and safety of a newly developed fixed-dose combination of 
      5-mg empagliflozin L-proline and 1000-mg metformin with the reference drug. A 
      randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-period, 2-treatment, crossover study was 
      conducted in healthy Korean subjects. The subjects received a single oral dose of 
      reference drug or test drug at each period. The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters 
      were calculated using a noncompartmental method. The geometric mean ratios and 
      90% confidence intervals of the plasma maximum concentration (C(max) ) and area 
      under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable 
      concentration (AUC(last) ) were calculated. A total of 27 healthy subjects were 
      included in the PK analysis. For empagliflozin, the geometric mean ratios (90% 
      confidence intervals) of the test to reference drug for C(max) and AUC(last) were 
      1.03 (0.99-1.08) and 1.03 (1.00-1.06), respectively. For metformin, the 
      corresponding values for C(max)  and AUC(last) were 0.99 (0.92-1.06) and 1.00 
      (0.94-1.06), respectively. In conclusion, a fixed-dose combination of 
      empagliflozin L-proline and metformin showed similar PK characteristics to the 
      reference drug, and both drugs were safe in healthy subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of sodium 
      glucose cotransporter 2, inhibition of which reduces renal glucose reabsorption 
      and results in increased urinary glucose excretion. Linagliptin is an oral 
      inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada. Due to their complementary modes 
      of action, there is a good rationale to combine empagliflozin with linagliptin to 
      improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin and 
      linagliptin after coadministration in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was an 
      open-label, randomized, multiple-dose, crossover study with 3 treatments in 2 
      treatment sequences. Sixteen healthy male subjects received treatment A 
      (empagliflozin 50 mg once daily [QD] for 5 days), treatment B (empagliflozin 50 
      mg QD and linagliptin 5 mg QD for 7 days), and treatment C (linagliptin 5 mg QD 
      for 7 days) in sequence AB then C, or sequence C then AB. RESULTS: Sixteen 
      healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 50 years with a body mass index of 18.5 
      to 29.9 kg/m(2) were included in the study. Linagliptin total exposure (AUC over 
      a uniform dosing interval τ at steady state geometric mean ratio [GMR], 1.03 [90% 
      CI, 0.96-1.11]) and peak exposure (C(max) at steady state GMR, 1.01 [90% CI, 
      0.87-1.19) exposure was unaffected by coadministration of empagliflozin. 
      Empagliflozin total exposure (AUC over a uniform dosing interval τ at steady 
      state GMR, 1.02 [90% CI, 0.97-1.07]) was unaffected by coadministration of 
      linagliptin. There was a reduction in empagliflozin peak exposure (C(max) at 
      steady state GMR, 0.88 [90% CI, 0.79-0.99]) when linagliptin was coadministered 
      that was not considered clinically meaningful. No adverse events were reported 
      during the coadministration period. No hypoglycemia was reported. Empagliflozin 
      and linagliptin were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: These data support the 
      coadministration of empagliflozin and linagliptin without dose adjustments.

TI  - Effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and assessment of dose proportionality in 
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 873-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Empagliflozin is an orally available, potent and highly selective 
      inhibitor of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). This study was 
      undertaken to investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of 25 mg 
      empagliflozin and to assess dose proportionality between 10 mg and 25 mg 
      empagliflozin under fasted conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, 
      3-way, cross-over study, 18 healthy volunteers received 3 single doses of 
      empagliflozin in a randomized sequence (25 mg empagliflozin under fasted 
      conditions, 25 mg empagliflozin after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast and 10 
      mg empagliflozin under fasted conditions), each separated by a washout period of 
      at least 7 days. Serial plasma samples were collected at selected time points 
      over a period of 72 hours. RESULTS: Administration with food had no clinically 
      relevant effect on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of 
      empagliflozin (geometric mean ratio (GMR): 84.04, 90% confidence interval (CI): 
      80.86 - 87.34). The decrease observed in the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) 
      of empagliflozin (GMR: 63.22, 90% CI: 56.74 - 70.44) when administered with food 
      was not considered clinically meaningful. The increases in AUC0-∞ and Cmax for 10 
      mg vs. 25 mg empagliflozin administered under fasting conditions were roughly 
      dose-proportional, as demonstrated by the slope β of the regression lines being 
      slightly less than 1 (slope β for AUC0-∞: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90 - 0.97; slope β for 
      Cmax: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80 - 1.01). Empagliflozin was well tolerated under fed and 
      fasting conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The results support administration of 
      empagliflozin tablets independently of food. Increases in empagliflozin exposure 
      under fasting conditions were roughly dose-proportional between 10 mg and 25 mg 
      empagliflozin.

TI  - Effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety 
      of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in Japanese 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of renal impairment 
      on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles of empagliflozin, a 
      sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in Japanese patients with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In an open-label, parallel-group study, 32 
      Japanese patients with T2DM and different degrees of renal function (n = 8 per 
      renal function category: normal renal function, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate [eGFR; Japanese equation] ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m(2); mild renal impairment, eGFR 
      of 60-<90 mL/min/1.73 m(2); moderate renal impairment, eGFR of 30-<60 mL/min/1.73 
      m(2); and severe renal impairment, eGFR of 15-<30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) received a 
      single 25 mg dose of empagliflozin. FINDINGS: Empagliflozin exposure increased 
      with increasing renal impairment. Maximum empagliflozin plasma concentrations 
      were similar among all renal function groups. Adjusted geometric mean ratios for 
      extent of exposure (AUC0-∞) to empagliflozin versus normal renal function were 
      128.8% (95% CI, 106.0-156.6%), 143.8% (95% CI, 118.3-174.8%), and 152.3% (95% CI, 
      125.3-185.2%) for patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, 
      respectively. Decreases in renal clearance of empagliflozin correlated with eGFR. 
      Urinary glucose excretion decreased with increasing renal impairment and 
      correlated with eGFR (adjusted mean [SE] change from baseline: 75.0 [4.84] g, 
      62.6 [5.75] g, 57.9 [4.86] g, and 23.7 [5.24] g for patients with normal renal 
      function and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively). Only 2 
      patients (6%) had adverse events; both were mild. IMPLICATIONS: Pharmacokinetic 
      data suggest that no dose adjustment of empagliflozin is necessary in Japanese 
      patients with T2DM and renal impairment because increases in exposure were 
      <2-fold. Urinary glucose excretion decreased with increasing renal impairment.

AB  - Diabetes and its complications account for a significant healthcare burden. There 
      is increasing prevalence of diabetes and newer drugs are being investigated to 
      improve outcomes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) are 
      a newer class of medications, which prevent renal reabsorption of glucose and 
      hence help in glycaemic control without significant risk of hypoglycaemia. Two 
      drugs, namely dapagliflozin and canagliflozin have gained approval and 
      empagliflozin is one of the advanced agents of this class. Early trials with 
      empagliflozin have shown a stable pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic 
      effects with significant SGLT2 selectivity. Clinical trials have shown 
      improvement in glycaemic control and other benefits including weight loss and 
      lowering of blood pressure. Ongoing trials and surveillance will provide answers 
      about cardiovascular benefits, risk of osteoporosis and cancer.

AB  - Evogliptin (EV) is a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) for glycemic 
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study evaluated 
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions between EV and 
      sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in healthy volunteers since 
      combination therapy of DPP4i and SGLT2i has been considered as an effective 
      option for T2DM treatment. A randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, two-arm, 
      three-period, three treatments, two-sequence crossover study was conducted in 
      healthy Korean volunteers. In arm 1, subjects were administered 5 mg of EV once 
      daily for 7 days, 25 mg of empagliflozin (EP) once daily for 5 days, and the 
      combination once daily for 5 days (EV + EP). In arm 2, subjects were administered 
      5 mg of EV once daily for 7 days, 10 mg of dapagliflozin (DP) once daily for 
      5 days, and the combination once daily for 5 days (EV + DP). Serial blood samples 
      were collected for PK analysis, and oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted 
      for PD analysis. In each arm, a total of 18 subjects completed the study. All 
      adverse events (AEs) were mild with no serious AEs. The geometric mean ratio and 
      confidence interval of the main PK parameters (maximum concentration of the drug 
      in plasma at steady state and area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve 
      within a dosing interval at a steady state) between EV and either EP or DP alone 
      were not significantly altered by co-administration. Administration of EV + EP or 
      EV + DP did not result in significant PD changes, as determined by the 
      glucose-lowering effect. Administration of EV + EP or EV + DP had no significant 
      effects on the PK profiles of each drug. All treatments were well-tolerated.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy can improve outcomes in type 2 
      diabetes (T2D). We evaluated the bioequivalence of 2 doses of an FDC of 
      extended-release metformin (metformin XR), empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter 2 inhibitor, and linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, 
      versus corresponding free tablet combinations. METHODS: Two randomized, 
      open-label, two-way crossover studies in healthy adults compared: 2 FDC tablets 
      of empagliflozin 5 mg/linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin XR 1000 mg (Study 1; N = 30), 
      1 FDC tablet of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg/metformin XR 1000 mg (Study 
      2; N = 30) versus corresponding dose of free combinations. Subjects received 
      study medication under fed conditions; washout was ≥35 days between treatments. 
      Primary endpoints: area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 
      0 to last quantifiable data point for empagliflozin and metformin; AUC from time 
      0 to 72 hours for linagliptin, and peak plasma concentration (C(max)) for 
      empagliflozin, linagliptin, and metformin. Bioequivalence was defined as adjusted 
      geometric mean ratios (FDC: free combination) and two-sided 90% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) of AUC and C(max) for each component within 80.00-125.00%. 
      RESULTS: Study 1: 27/29 and 28/30 treated participants were included in the 
      pharmacokinetic analysis for the FDC and free combination periods, respectively. 
      Study 2: 29/29 treated participants were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis 
      for both periods. The adjusted geometric mean ratios of FDCs to their respective 
      free tablet combinations and two-sided 90% CIs were all within the predefined 
      range. The shapes of the mean plasma concentration-time profile of empagliflozin, 
      linagliptin, and metformin XR were similar for subjects in the FDC and free 
      combination groups in both studies. No serious adverse events were reported. 
      CONCLUSION: The evaluated doses of empagliflozin/linagliptin/metformin XR FDC 
      tablets were bioequivalent to the corresponding free combinations. Based on these 
      two bioequivalence studies and existing phase 3 data, the FDA has recently 
      approved this triple FDC to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the availability of numerous anti-diabetes drugs and 
      treatment guidelines, many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) do not 
      reach recommended targets for glycemic control. There remains an unmet need for 
      effective and well-tolerated anti-diabetes agents that can be used as monotherapy 
      or in combination with other therapies to improve glycemic control in patients 
      with T2DM. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of 
      treatment for T2DM that reduce hyperglycemia by reducing renal glucose 
      reabsorption and thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion. AREAS COVERED: 
      This paper reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the 
      SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin , the results of clinical trials investigating the 
      efficacy of empagliflozin given as monotherapy or as add-on therapy on glycemic 
      control, body weight, and blood pressure in patients with T2DM, and the safety 
      and tolerability profile of empagliflozin. EXPERT OPINION: Empagliflozin offers 
      good glycemic efficacy, weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and a low risk of 
      hypoglycemia. These attributes, coupled with the ability to be used in virtually 
      any combination with other anti-diabetes agents and at any stage in the disease 
      process, provide a welcome new agent to our armamentarium of drugs to help manage 
      T2DM.

AB  - Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. SGLT2 
      cotransporters are responsible for reabsorption of 90 % of the glucose filtered 
      by the kidney. The glucuretic effect resulting from SGLT2 inhibition contributes 
      to reduce hyperglycaemia and also assists weight loss and blood pressure 
      reduction. Several SGLT2 inhibitors are already available in many countries 
      (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) and in Japan (ipragliflozin, 
      tofogliflozin). These SGLT2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics with a rapid oral absorption, a long elimination half-life 
      allowing once-daily administration, an extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via 
      glucuronidation to inactive metabolites and a low renal elimination as a parent 
      drug. Pharmacokinetic parameters are slightly altered in the case of chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). While no dose adjustment is required in the case of mild 
      CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors may not be used or only at a lower daily dose in patients 
      with moderate CKD. Furthermore, the pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors 
      as assessed by urinary glucose excretion declines with increasing severity of 
      renal impairment as assessed by a reduction in the estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate. Nevertheless, the glucose-lowering efficacy and safety of SGLT2 
      inhibitors are almost comparable in patients with mild CKD as in patients with 
      normal kidney function. In patients with moderate CKD, the efficacy tends to be 
      dampened and safety concerns may occur. In patients with severe CKD, the use of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors is contraindicated. Thus, prescribing information should be 
      consulted regarding dosage adjustments or restrictions in the case of renal 
      dysfunction for each SGLT2 inhibitor. The clinical impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on 
      renal function and their potential to influence the course of diabetic 
      nephropathy deserve attention because of preliminary favourable results in animal 
      models.

AB  - A fast, sensitive one step UPLC ESI-MS/MS method was successfully applied for the 
      simultaneous estimation of two concurrently administrated antidiabetic drugs, 
      Metformin (MET) and Empagliflozin (EMPA) in human plasma. Metformin-d6 (MET-d6) 
      and Empagliflozin-d4 (EMPA-d4) were utilized as internal standards. Extraction of 
      the analytes from the human plasma was performed through acetonitrile 
      precipitation technique followed by freezing the precipitated plasma proteins and 
      lipids to minimize the matrix effect. Chromatographic analysis was developed on 
      Acquity UPLC BEH C(18) column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm) using isocratic elution mode. 
      A mobile phase of formic acid (0.01 %): acetonitrile (70:30 v/v) with a flow rate 
      of 0.3 mL/min achieved optimum separation. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in

      →71.29 for (EMPA), 136.03 →77.02 for (MET-d6), and 455.43 → 75.05 for (EMPA-d4) 
      was used for quantification. The obtained linearity covered the concentration 
      ranges of 10-1500 ng/mL and 2.0-250.0 ng/mL for MET and EMPA, respectively. The 
      run time of the proposed Method didn't exceed 3.0 min allowing faster analysis 
      and determination of larger number of samples per day without affecting accuracy 
      and sensitivity. The presented chromatographic method could be successfully 
      applied in pharmacokinetics studies and therapeutic monitoring of MET and EMPA in 
      patients' plasma administrating fixed dose combination of both drug with high 
      reproducibility and ruggedness.

AB  - 1. The absorption, biotransformation and excretion of empagliflozin, an SGLT2 
      inhibitor, were evaluated in eight healthy subjects following a single 50 mg oral 
      dose of empagliflozin containing ∼100 µCi [(14)C]-empagliflozin. 2. Radioactivity 
      was rapidly absorbed, with plasma levels peaking 1 h post-dose. Total exposure 
      was lower in blood versus plasma, consistent with moderate (28.6-36.8%) red blood 
      cell partitioning. Protein binding was 80.3-86.2%. 3. Most of the radioactive 
      dose was recovered in urine (54.4%) and faeces (41.1%). Unchanged empagliflozin 
      was the most abundant drug-related component in plasma, representing 75.5-77.4% 
      of plasma radioactivity and 79.6% plasma radioactivity AUC0-12 h. Unchanged 
      empagliflozin was the most abundant drug-related component in urine and faeces, 
      representing 43.5% (23.7% of dose) and 82.9% (34.1% of dose) of radioactivity in 
      urine and faeces, respectively. Six metabolites were identified in plasma: three 
      glucuronide conjugates representing 4.7-7.1% of AUC0-12 h and three less abundant 
      metabolites (<0.2-1.9% AUC0-12 h). The most abundant metabolites in urine were 
      two glucuronide conjugates (7.8-13.2% of dose) and in faeces was a 
      tetrahydrofuran ring-opened carboxylic acid metabolite (1.9% of dose). 4. To 
      conclude, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed and excreted primarily unchanged in 
      urine and faeces. Unchanged parent was the major drug-related component in 
      plasma. Metabolism was primarily via glucuronide conjugation.

LID - 10.2174/0115733998271026231127051545 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor 
      that has gained significant attention in the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Understanding its chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology is crucial 
      for the safe and effective use of this medication. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to 
      provide a comprehensive overview of the chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology 
      of empagliflozin, synthesizing the available literature to present a concise 
      summary of its properties and implications for clinical practice. METHODS: A 
      systematic search of relevant databases was conducted to identify studies and 
      articles related to the chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of empagliflozin. 
      Data from preclinical and clinical studies, as well as post-marketing 
      surveillance reports, were reviewed to provide a comprehensive understanding of 
      the topic. RESULTS: Empagliflozin is a selective SGLT2 inhibitor that works by 
      constraining glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, causing increased urinary 
      glucose elimination. Its unique mechanism of action provides glycemic control, 
      weight reduction, and blood pressure reduction. The drug's chemistry is 
      characterized by its chemical structure, solubility, and stability. 
      Pharmacologically, empagliflozin exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties 
      with rapid absorption, extensive protein binding, and renal elimination. Clinical 
      studies have demonstrated its efficacy in improving glycemic control, reducing 
      cardiovascular risks, and preserving renal function. However, adverse effects, 
      for instance, urinary tract infections, genital infections, and diabetic 
      ketoacidosis have been reported. Toxicological studies indicate low potential for 
      organ toxicity, mutagenicity, or carcinogenicity. CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin is a 
      promising SGLT2 inhibitor that offers an innovative approach to the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its unique action mechanism and favorable 
      pharmacokinetic profile contribute to its efficacy in improving glycemic control 
      and reducing cardiovascular risks. While the drug's safety profile is generally 
      favorable, clinicians should be aware of potential adverse effects and monitor 
      patients closely. More study is required to determine the longterm safety and 
      explore potential benefits in other patient populations. Overall, empagliflozin 
      represents a valuable addition to the armamentarium of antidiabetic medications, 
      offering significant benefits to patients suffering from type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. This study covers all aspects of empagliflozin, including its history, 
      chemistry, pharmacology, and various clinical studies, case reports, and case 
      series.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic properties and tolerability of the oral once-daily sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin, given in single and multiple 10 and 25 
      mg doses in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In a 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, Chinese patients with 
      T2DM were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg 
      or placebo on day 1 and once daily on days 3 to 9. FINDINGS: A total of 24 
      patients were enrolled (14 men, 10 women; median age, 53.5 years; empagliflozin 
      10 mg, n = 9; empagliflozin 25 mg, n = 9; and placebo, n = 6). After both single- 
      and multiple-dose administration, empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg were rapidly 
      absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 1.5 hours (median), 
      with plasma levels declining biphasically. Empagliflozin exposure increased 
      roughly dose proportionally between 10 and 25 mg. Mean terminal elimination 
      half-life values at steady state were 13.9 and 12.1 hours with empagliflozin 10 
      and 25 mg, respectively. Mean (SD) changes from baseline in 24-hour urinary 
      glucose excretion (UGE) on day 1 were +87.7 (22.9) and +82.8 (18.8) g with 
      empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared with -1.0 (2.8) g with 
      placebo, and on day 9 were +95.8 (24.1), +82.6 (34.8) g with empagliflozin 10 and 
      25 mg, respectively, compared with -4.1 (6.4) g with placebo. Mean (SD) changes 
      from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) on day 2 were -18.7 (17.2) mg/dL 
      and -25.8 (19.6) mg/dL with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared 
      with -4.2 (15.2) mg/dL with placebo, and on day 9, were -25.6 (20.7) mg/dL and 
      -31.4 (26.9) mg/dL with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared to 
      -3.7 (7.5) mg/dL with placebo. On day 10, mean changes in weight were -1.1, -1.6, 
      and +0.5 kg with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo, respectively. Overall, 
      empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg had safety profiles similar to that of placebo. There 
      were no reports of hypoglycemia, urinary tract infections, or genital infections. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Results with single and multiple doses of empagliflozin 10 and 25 
      mg suggest linear pharmacokinetic properties in Chinese patients with T2DM, with 
      a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Empagliflozin treatment was 
      associated with increases in UGE and reductions in FPG compared with placebo.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 -inhibitors (SGLT2i) are oral glucose-lowering 
      drugs that have also demonstrated cardioprotective and renoprotective effects. 
      SGLT2i play an increasingly important role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
      Here we report a simple and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of three SGLT2i 
      (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) in human plasma, serum and urine 
      with a runtime of 1 min. Methanol was used as protein precipitating agent. 
      Chromatographic separation was accomplished using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 
      1.8 μm; 2.1 × 50 mm column with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm VanGuard 
      Pre-column; 2.1 × 5 mm, using gradient elution with ammonium acetate 20 mM (pH 5) 
      and acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Mass spectrometric 
      analysis of the acetate adduct ions was carried out using electrospray with 
      negative ionization and SRM mode. The assay was validated according to FDA and 
      EMA guidelines, including selectivity, linearity, accuracy and precision, 
      dilution integrity, stability and recovery. With a sample volume of 200 µl, 
      linear ranges of 10-5000 µg/L, 1-500 µg/L and 2-1000 µg/L for canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin respectively, were achieved. The assay was 
      successfully applied in two pharmacokinetic studies with dapagliflozin and 
      empagliflozin. In conclusion, we developed and validated a simple, fast and 
      robust LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, that allows rapid analysis of large numbers of 
      samples and can be used for both pharmacokinetic studies and biomedical analysis 
      of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) affects more than 60 million individuals globally. 
      Empagliflozin is currently approved for type 2 diabetes and chronic HF. Clinical 
      trials have demonstrated that empagliflozin reduces the composite end point of 
      hospitalizations for HF and mortality and improves the quality of life 
      irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction. Empagliflozin is a once-daily 
      medication with minimal drug-drug interactions and does not require titration. 
      Empagliflozin causes mild weight loss and does not significantly reduce blood 
      pressure. Empagliflozin acts as an enabler for other HF drugs by reducing the 
      risk of hyperkalemia. Empagliflozin is also beneficial for chronic kidney disease 
      which exists commonly with HF. This review outlines the pharmacokinetics, 
      pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of empagliflozin in HF across various 
      sub-groups and settings.

OAB - Empagliflozin is a one-daily medication and is an effective glucose-lowering drug 
      for the treatment of diabetes. In recent years, researchers and medical 
      professionals have discovered that empagliflozin may also be used to treat some 
      cardiovascular conditions. Numerous people suffer from myocardial infarction 
      (‘heart attack’) each year. According to several clinical trials, empagliflozin 
      may slow the course of myocardial infarction and improve clinical outcomes and 
      quality of life. Additionally, empagliflozin does not result in a substantial 
      decrease in blood pressure and can also lead to mild weight loss. Therefore, 
      empagliflozin shows potential as a useful medication for the treatment of 
      myocardial infarction, especially in individuals with diabetes and impaired 
      kidney function.

TI  - The safety of empagliflozin plus metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 837-848
LID - 10.1080/14740338.2018.1497159 [doi]
AB  - Metformin is the first-line glucose-lowering medication in type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM), but it generally requires soon or later the addition of a 
      second-line therapy, among which a sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor, to reach and maintain adequate glucose control. Areas covered: This 
      narrative review provides an analysis of both efficacy and safety of a dual 
      therapy combining metformin and empagliflozin, a SGLT-2 inhibitor that has proven 
      its' potential to reduce major cardiovascular (CV) events, mortality, and renal 
      outcomes in patients with T2DM and established CV disease. Pharmacokinetic 
      studies showed the absence of drug-drug interactions and demonstrate 
      bioequivalence between fixed-dose combination (FDC) and individual tablets of 
      empagliflozin and metformin. Focus will be put on the use of this dual therapy in 
      special populations. Expert opinion: The addition of empagliflozin to metformin 
      therapy improves glucose control, with a minimal risk of hypoglycemia, while 
      reducing body weight and arterial blood pressure. EMPA-REG OUTCOME showed that 
      this combined therapy may be used in patients with established CV disease or 
      heart failure. However, caution may be required in fragile elderly patients and 
      in patients with severe impaired renal function. Further post-marketing 
      surveillance is recommended to demonstrate long-term safety. FDC may improve 
      adherence.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose

PG  - 213-225

AB  - Empagliflozin is an orally active, potent and selective inhibitor of sodium 
      glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), currently in clinical development to improve 
      glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). SGLT2 
      inhibitors, including empagliflozin, are the first pharmacological class of 
      antidiabetes agents to target the kidney in order to remove excess glucose from 
      the body and, thus, offer new options for T2DM management. SGLT2 inhibitors exert 
      their effects independently of insulin. Following single and multiple oral doses 
      (0.5-800 mg), empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed and reached peak plasma 
      concentrations after approximately 1.33-3.0 h, before showing a biphasic decline. 
      The mean terminal half-life ranged from 5.6 to 13.1 h in single rising-dose 
      studies, and from 10.3 to 18.8 h in multiple-dose studies. Following multiple 
      oral doses, increases in exposure were dose-proportional and trough 
      concentrations remained constant after day 6, indicating a steady state had been 
      reached. Oral clearance at steady state was similar to corresponding single-dose 
      values, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. No clinically 
      relevant alterations in pharmacokinetics were observed in mild to severe hepatic 
      impairment, or in mild to severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease. 
      Clinical studies did not reveal any relevant drug-drug interactions with several 
      other drugs commonly prescribed to patients with T2DM, including warfarin. 
      Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) rates were higher with empagliflozin versus 
      placebo and increased with dose, but no relevant impact on 24-h urine volume was 
      observed. Increased UGE resulted in proportional reductions in fasting plasma 
      glucose and mean daily glucose concentrations.

AB  - Fluorescence spectroscopy has an important role in the determination of very 
      small quantities of substances, especially in biological fluids. For this reason, 
      most analysts have adopted the use of this technique in their biological studies 
      and research, which helps them in the determination of any substance found in 
      trace amounts. In addition to the high sensitivity of the fluorimetric technique, 
      it has the advantages of simplicity and being green for the environment. All 
      these reasons encourage the use of fluorimetric spectroscopy for quantifying 
      co-administered therapy in biological fluids, which is considered a crucial step 
      for patients, particularly in emergent cases requiring monitoring of administered 
      therapeutic drugs. In this work, a sensitive, simple, economic, and 
      environmentally friendly fluorimetric analytical technique was developed for the 
      simultaneous determination of prucalopride succinate (a novel anti-constipation 
      agent) and empagliflozin (an anti-diabetic agent) in pharmaceutical forms and 
      spiked plasma depending on third-derivative signal processing at 333 and 314 nm, 
      respectively. Conventional fluorescence spectra of both drugs showed a large 
      overlap that hindered their simultaneous determination. So, third-order 
      derivative fluorescence was adopted to overcome this overlap. The 
      third-derivative corresponding to each spectrum was recorded using data 
      points = 17 and a scaling factor of 10. The greenness of the proposed method was 
      evaluated using an eco-scale scoring system, revealing excellent greenness. 
      Analytical method parameters were validated following ICH guidelines. The method 
      showed high sensitivity, covering a concentration range of 50-1100 ng/mL and 
      4-500 ng/mL for empagliflozin and prucalopride, respectively, allowing the 
      pharmacokinetic study of both drugs in biological fluids. The LOD values were 
      14.09 and 0.91 ng/mL, while the LOQ values were 42.72 and 2.77 ng/mL for 
      empagliflozin and prucalopride, respectively.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) agent sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitors show special benefits in reducing body weight and heart failure risks. 
      To accelerate clinical development for novel SGLT2 inhibitors, a quantitative 
      relationship among pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and disease end points 
      (PK/PD/end points) in healthy subjects and patients with T2DM was developed. 
      PK/PD/end point data in published clinical studies for three globally marketed 
      SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin) were collected 
      according to pre-set criteria. Overall, 80 papers with 880 PK, 27 PD, 848 fasting 
      plasma glucose (FPG), and 1219 hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) data were collected. A 
      two-compartmental model with Hill's equation was utilized to capture PK/PD 
      profiles. A novel translational biomarker, the change of urine glucose excretion 
      (UGE) from baseline normalized by FPG (ΔUGE(c) ) was identified to bridge healthy 
      subjects and patients with T2DM with different disease statuses. ΔUGE(c) was 
      found to have a similar maximum increase with different half-maximal effective 
      concentration values of 56.6, 2310, and 841 mg/mL·h for dapagliflozin, 
      canagliflozin, and empagliflozin respectively. ΔUGE(c) will change FPG based on 
      linear function. HbA1c profiles were captured by indirect response model. 
      Additional placebo effect was also considered for both end points. The PK/ΔUGE(c) 
      /FPG/HbA1c relationship was validated internally using diagnostic plots and 
      visual assessment and further validated externally using the fourth globally 
      approved same-in-class drug (ertugliflozin). This validated quantitative 
      PK/PD/end point relationship offers novel insight into long-term efficacy 
      prediction for SGLT2 inhibitors. The novelty identified ΔUGE(c) could make the 
      comparison of different SGLT2 inhibitors' efficacy characteristics easier, and 
      achieve early prediction from healthy subjects to patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacokinetics of fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
      tablets of empagliflozin/metformin with individual tablets taken together. 
      METHODS: In 3 randomized, open-label studies, healthy subjects received a single 
      FDC tablet of empagliflozin/metformin in 1 of 6 dose combinations (empagliflozin 
      12.5 mg or 5 mg; metformin 500 mg, 850 mg, or 1,000 mg) in 1 period and the 
      individual tablets taken together under fed conditions in another period. 
      Empagliflozin 12.5 mg/metformin 1,000 mg FDC and individual tablets were also 
      given under fasted conditions. RESULTS: Adjusted geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of 
      empagliflozin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-∞)) for the 
      FDCs vs. individual tablets ranged from 97.92 to 106.00%, and 90% CIs ranged from 
      93.53 to 109.39%. Adjusted GMRs of empagliflozin maximum plasma concentrations 
      (C(max)) for the FDCs vs. individual tablets ranged from 100.97 to 106.52%, and 
      90% CIs ranged from 95.86 to 118.35%. Adjusted GMRs of metformin AUC(0-∞) for the 
      FDCs vs. individual tablets ranged from 96.25 to 101.61%, and 90% CIs ranged from 
      88.54 to 106.62%. Adjusted GMRs of metformin C(max) for the FDCs vs. individual 
      tablets ranged from 93.83 to 102.95%, and 90% CIs ranged from 88.01 to 109.08%. 
      Bioequivalence was also established under fasted conditions for empagliflozin 
      12.5 mg/metformin 1,000 mg FDC vs. individual tablets taken together. All 
      treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin/metformin FDC tablets 
      were found to be bioequivalent to individual tablets taken together at all tested 
      dose strengths.

AB  - A review of publications devoted to the analysis of genetic polymorphisms and 
      features of the functioning of genes that affect the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) is 
      presented. Objective of the study was to reveal information about genes whose 
      polymorphism may affect the effectiveness of SGLT2i. The review was carried out 
      in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 recommendations, the search for publications 
      was carried out in the PubMed databases (including Medline), Web of Science, as 
      well as Russian scientific electronic libraries eLIBRARY.RU from 1993 to 2022. 
      Polymorphisms in the structure of several genes (SLC5A2, UGT1A9, ABCB1, PNPLA3) 
      have been described that may affect the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      complicated by diseases such as chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The information found on the genetic features 
      of the development of the effects of SGLT2i is limited to a description of the 
      differences in their pharmacokinetics. The relevance of currently available 
      pharmacogenetic studies is largely constrained by small sample sizes.

TI  - The Validation and Determination of Empagliflozin Concentration in the Presence 
      of Grapefruit Juice Using HPLC for Pharmacokinetic Applications.
LID - 10.3390/molecules29061236 [doi]
LID - 1236
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disorder whose primary manifestation 
      usually initiates with elevated blood sugar levels. Several antidiabetic agents 
      are used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus, of which empagliflozin is an oral 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT-2) inhibitor in the kidney. This research 
      aims to develop and validate a simple analytical method for determining 
      empagliflozin levels in biological fluid and to further evaluate grapefruit 
      juice's impact on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics in rats. High-Performance Liquid 
      Chromatography (HPLC) was used to establish a simple, rapid, and accurate method 
      for determining empagliflozin levels in rat plasma, in the presence of grapefruit 
      juice. Four groups of rats (n = 10 rats in each) were used in the preclinical 
      study. Group A (healthy rats) received empagliflozin alone; Group B (healthy 
      rats) received empagliflozin with grapefruit; Group C (diabetic rats) received 
      empagliflozin with grapefruit; and Group D (healthy, negative control) received 
      no medication. The rats (n = 10) were given grapefruit juice instead of water for 
      seven days before receiving the empagliflozin dose (0.16 mg/kg). Some 
      pharmacokinetic parameters for each group were determined. The maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max)) and area under the curve (AUC) of empagliflozin in Group A 
      without grapefruit intake were 730 ng/mL and 9264.6 ng × h/mL, respectively, with 
      T(max) (2 h). In Group B, C(max) was 1907 ng/mL and AUC was 10,290.75 ng × h/mL 
      in the presence of grapefruit, with T(max) (1 h); whereas, in Group C, the C(max) 
      was 2936 ng/mL and AUC was 18657 ng × h/mL, with T(max) (2 h). In conclusion, our 
      results showed that the co-administration of grapefruit with empagliflozin should 
      be cautiously monitored and avoided, in which grapefruit elevates the plasma 
      level of empagliflozin. This may be attributed to the inhibition of the uridine 
      enzyme in the grapefruit by hesperidin, naringin, and flavonoid.

AB  - The sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 offer a novel approach to treating type 
      2 diabetes by reducing hyperglycaemia via increased urinary glucose excretion. In 
      the present study, the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacologic 
      properties of all six SGLT2 inhibitors commercially available in Japan were 
      investigated and compared. Based on findings in normal and diabetic mice, the six 
      drugs were classified into two categories, long-acting: ipragliflozin and 
      dapagliflozin, and intermediate-acting: tofogliflozin, canagliflozin, 
      empagliflozin, and luseogliflozin. Long-acting SGLT2 inhibitors exerted an 
      antihyperglycemic effect with lower variability of blood glucose level via a 
      long-lasting increase in urinary glucose excretion. In addition, ipragliflozin 
      and luseogliflozin exhibited superiority over the others with respect to fast 
      onset of pharmacological effect. Duration and onset of the pharmacologic effects 
      seemed to be closely correlated with the pharmacokinetic properties of each SGLT2 
      inhibitor, particularly with respect to high distribution and long retention in 
      the target organ, the kidney. While all six SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly 
      effective in increasing urinary glucose excretion and reducing hyperglycemia, our 
      findings suggest that variation in the quality of daily blood glucose control 
      associated with duration and onset of pharmacologic effects of each SGLT2 
      inhibitor might cause slight differences in rates of improvement in type 2 
      diabetes.

TI  - SGLT-2 Inhibitors: Focus on Dapagliflozin.
LID - 10.1097/CRD.0000000000000694 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin (trade name FARXIGA) is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor that has transcended its initial antidiabetic application to 
      demonstrate benefits in cardiac and renal diseases. It was first approved by the 
      food and department administration for type 2 diabetes in 2014. Since then, it 
      has gained food and department administration approval for chronic kidney disease 
      in 2021, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in 2020, and heart failure 
      with preserved ejection fraction in 2023. Thus, dapagliflozin plays a pivotal 
      role in improving patient outcomes. By competitive binding to renal SGLT-2 
      cotransporters, dapagliflozin effectively prevents glucose and sodium 
      reabsorption, leading to glucosuria. Its pharmacokinetic profile involves minimal 
      cytochrome P450-induced metabolism, rapid absorption with an 18-hour duration of 
      action, and stable effects. Clinical trials have revealed dapagliflozin's 
      efficacy in glycemic control without the risk of hypoglycemia, making it an 
      advantageous choice for patients insufficiently managed on other antidiabetic 
      drugs. Comparative analysis with other SGLT-2 inhibitors suggests dapagliflozin's 
      potential superiority in preventing heart failure. Compared to empagliflozin, it 
      has more extended effects, contributing to stable sodium diuresis, reduced blood 
      pressure fluctuations, and potentially lower cardiovascular disease risks. 
      However, it leads to less urinary glucose excretion compared with canagliflozin. 
      Dapagliflozin has specific contraindications, such as type 1 diabetes and 
      end-stage chronic kidney disease. Adverse effects include an increased risk of 
      genital infections, urinary tract infections, and Fournier's gangrene. A nuanced 
      understanding of dapagliflozin's benefits and limitations is imperative for 
      informed clinical decision-making in the management of diabetes and its 
      complications.

TI  - Empagliflozin containing chitosan-alginate nanoparticles in orodispersible film: 
      preparation, characterization, pharmacokinetic evaluation and its in-vitro 
      anticancer activity.
PG  - 279-291
LID - 10.1080/03639045.2022.2108829 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to develop the orodispersity film 
      containing chitosan-alginate nanoparticles to improve dissolution profile, 
      therapeutic effect with improved bioavailability of empagliflozin through oral 
      route noninvasively for further cytotoxicity study. METHODS: The nanoparticles 
      were developed through two-step mechanisms ionotropic pre-gelation and 
      polyelectrolyte complexation methods. The prepared nanoparticles were added to a 
      polymer matrix containing hypromellose, polyvinyl alcohol, and maltodextrin and 
      cast to rapidly dissolving thin film by solvent casting method. RESULTS: The 
      physicochemical characteristics of empagliflozin in the orodispersible film were 
      most favorable for further studies. This formulation has achieved a higher 
      permeability (7.2-fold) as compared to the reference drug product (Jardiance) 
      after 45 min. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats have revealed that 
      chitosan-alginate empagliflozin nanoparticles in the orodispersible film were 
      1.18-fold more bioavailable in comparison to free empagliflozin in orodispersible 
      film. The C(max) observed for the empagliflozin-loaded orodispersible film was 
      15.42 ± 5.13 μg/mL in comparison to 18.21 ± 5.53 μg/mL for empagliflozin 
      nanoparticle-containing orodispersible film and 12.19 ± 6.71 μg/mL for freed rug 
      suspension. The t(1/2)and AUC(0-t) values for chitosan-alginate nanoparticles of 
      empagliflozin in the orodispersible film were found1.4-fold more than 
      empagliflozin loaded orodispersible film (without nanoparticles). The 
      cytotoxicity study has shown that chitosan-alginate nanoparticles of 
      empagliflozin in orodispersible film achieved a 2.5-fold higher cytotoxic effect 
      than free empagliflozin in orodispersible film in A549lung cancer cells. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that chitosan-alginate nanoparticles of 
      empagliflozin in orodispersible film can be an effective drug carrier system to 
      improve sustained effect with better bioavailability of poorly water-soluble 
      drug.

AB  - Glyxambi(®) (empagliflozin/linagliptin) is a fixed-dose, once-daily tablet 
      combining a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor with a dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. Glyxambi(®) is served as an adjuvant to diet and 
      exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes when both 
      empagliflozin and linagliptin are appropriate treatments. Glyxambi(®) combines 
      10mg or 25mg empagliflozin with 5mg linagliptin, with different, complementary 
      mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 
      diabetes. Empagliflozin removes glucose through the urine by blocking blood 
      glucose re-absorption in the kidney, and linagliptin exerts glucose-lowering 
      activity by increasing hormones that stimulate the pancreas to produce more 
      insulin and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. In addition, 
      this combination therapy modestly reduces body weight and blood pressure without 
      significant safety issues.

TI  - A novel microextraction technique aided by air agitation using a natural 
      hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent for the extraction of fluvastatin and 
      empagliflozin from plasma samples: application to pharmacokinetic and drug-drug 
      interaction study.
PG  - 31201-31212
LID - 10.1039/d3ra05929d [doi]
AB  - This study focuses on the interaction between the antihyperlipidemic drug 
      fluvastatin (FLV) and the antidiabetic drug empagliflozin (EMP), which are 
      commonly co-administered medications. EMP's impact on FLV levels is attributed to 
      its inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), 
      responsible for FLV liver uptake, consequently elevating FLV concentrations in 
      blood. Traditional extraction methods for FLV faced difficulties due to its high 
      hydrophobicity. In this study, a hydrophobic natural deep eutectic solvent (NDES) 
      using air assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (AA-DLLME) was 
      utilized as an excellent choice for achieving the highest extraction recovery, 
      reaching 96% for FLV and 92% for EMP. The NDES was created through the 
      combination of menthol and hippuric acid in a 4 : 1 ratio, making it a green and 
      cost-effective pathway. Liquid phase microextraction followed by 
      spectrofluorometric measurements of FLV at λ(em) = 395 nm and EMP at λ(em) = 303 
      nm, with excitation at a single wavelength of 275 nm was carried out. Response 
      surface methodology (RSM) relying on central composite design (CCD) was used to 
      optimize the variables affecting the AA-NDES-DLLME. The optimized conditions for 
      extraction are: NDES volume of 200 μL, centrifugation time of 15 minutes, 
      air-agitation cycle of 6 cycles, and sample pH of 4.0. Under these optimized 
      conditions, the developed method exhibited good linearity and precision. The 
      method showed good recoveries from rabbit plasma samples spiked at varying 
      concentrations of the analyzed compounds. To assess the applicability and 
      effectiveness of the hydrophobic DES, the validated method was applied to extract 
      the studied drugs from rabbit plasma samples after oral administration of FLV 
      alone and in combination with EMP. The pharmacokinetic parameters of FLV were 
      calculated in both cases to investigate any changes and determine the need for 
      dose adjustment.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor, coadministered with sitagliptin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 889-99
LID - 10.1007/s12325-012-0055-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This randomized, open-label, crossover study investigated potential 
      drug-drug interactions between the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor empagliflozin and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor 
      sitagliptin. Empagliflozin is a potent and selective SGLT-2 inhibitor that lowers 
      blood glucose levels by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, leading to an 
      increase in urinary glucose excretion. Sitagliptin lowers blood glucose through 
      an insulin-dependent mechanism of action. METHODS: Sixteen healthy male 
      volunteers received three treatments (A, B, C) in one of two treatment sequences 
      (AB then C, or C then AB). In treatment AB, 50 mg empagliflozin was administered 
      once daily (q.d.) for 5 days (treatment A), immediately followed by 
      coadministration of 50 mg empagliflozin q.d. and 100 mg sitagliptin q.d. over 5 
      days (treatment B). In treatment C, 100 mg sitagliptin was administered q.d. for 
      5 days. A washout period of ≥7 days separated treatments AB and C. RESULTS: 
      Coadministration of sitagliptin with empagliflozin did not have a clinically 
      relevant effect on the area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in 
      plasma at steady state over a uniform dosing interval τ (AUC(τ,ss)) (geometric 
      mean ratio [GMR] 110.4; 90% confidence interval [CI] 103.9, 117.3) or maximum 
      measured concentration of the analyte in plasma at steady state over a uniform 
      dosing interval τ (C (max,ss)) (GMR 107.6; 90% CI 97.0, 119.4) of empagliflozin. 
      Coadministration of empagliflozin with sitagliptin did not have a clinically 
      meaningful effect on the AUC(τ,ss) (GMR 103.1; 90% CI 98.9, 107.3) or C (max,ss) 
      (GMR 108.5; 90% CI 100.7, 116.9) of sitagliptin. Empagliflozin and sitagliptin 
      were well tolerated when given alone or in combination. Five subjects (31.3%) 
      reported at least one adverse event (AE): three (18.8%) experienced an AE while 
      receiving empagliflozin monotherapy and three (18.8%) while receiving sitagliptin 
      monotherapy. No adverse events were reported during the coadministration period. 
      No AEs were regarded as drug-related by the investigator. CONCLUSION: These 
      results indicate that empagliflozin and sitagliptin can be coadministered without 
      dose adjustments.

TI  - Empagliflozin: a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for treatment of type 2 
      diabetes.
PG  - 1943-54
LID - 10.2146/ajhp150071 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, 
      adverse effects, dosage and administration, and drug-drug interactions of 
      empagliflozin are reviewed. SUMMARY: Empagliflozin is a direct inhibitor of 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), which acts to lower the renal threshold 
      and increase urinary glucose excretion. SGLT2 is found in the proximal tubules of 
      the kidneys and reabsorbs about 90% of the filtered glucose. Because the 
      mechanism of action of empagliflozin is not insulin dependent or insulin 
      sensitive, it may be used in patients at different stages of diabetes with 
      nonfunctional or impaired pancreatic β cells. Furthermore, empagliflozin can be 
      used with other antidiabetic drugs due to its lack of any additive hypoglycemic 
      effects. Long-term efficacy studies revealed significant reductions with 
      empagliflozin in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values at week 78 compared with 
      placebo. Secondary endpoints in clinical trials showed improvements in lowering 
      blood pressure and reductions in body weight. The risk:benefit ratio must be 
      assessed for empagliflozin as the safety profile includes an increase in urinary 
      and genital infections. CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin has shown efficacy in lowering 
      HbA1c and blood glucose levels both as monotherapy and as an add-on to existing 
      therapy. Despite the drug's promising outlook, empagliflozin also leads to common 
      but serious adverse events not seen with other classes of antihyperglycemic 
      agents. Considering the current data on its efficacy and its safety profile, 
      empagliflozin can be used as a second- or third-line agent in treating diabetes.

TI  - Sex-, Species-, and Tissue-Specific Metabolism of Empagliflozin in Male Mouse 
      Kidney Forms an Unstable Hemiacetal Metabolite (M466/2) That Degrades to 
      4-Hydroxycrotonaldehyde, a Reactive and Cytotoxic Species.
PG  - 103-15
LID - 10.1021/tx500380t [doi]
AB  - Following oral administration of empagliflozin (1000 mg/kg/day) to male and 
      female CD-1 mice for 2 years, renal tubular injury was identified in male mice. 
      Renal injury was not detected in male mice (≤300 mg/kg/day), in female mice (1000 
      mg/kg/day), or in male or female Han Wistar rats (700 mg/kg/day). Using 
      transfected HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes, empagliflozin was found to be a 
      substrate of various mouse and rat organic anion transporters (oat/Oat) and 
      organic anion transporting polypeptide (oatp/Oatp) transporters: mouse oat3, rat 
      Oat3, mouse oatp1a1, and rat Oatp1a1. However, using isolated kidney slices from 
      male and female mice and rats, no sex-based difference in the extent of uptake of 
      empagliflozin occurred. Metabolism studies using hepatic and renal microsomes 
      from male and female mice, rats, and humans revealed a hemiacetal metabolite of 
      empagliflozin (M466/2), predominantly formed in male mouse kidney microsomes. 
      Formation of M466/2 in male mouse kidney microsomes was 31-fold higher compared 
      to that in female mouse kidney microsomes and was ∼29- and ∼20-fold higher 
      compared to that in male and female mouse liver microsomes, respectively. M466/2 
      is unstable and degrades to form a phenol metabolite (M380/1) and 
      4-hydroxycrotonaldehyde (4-OH CTA). Formed 4-OH CTA was trapped by reduced GSH, 
      and the structure of the GSH adduct was confirmed by mass spectrometry. 
      Stoichiometric formation of M380/1 from M466/2 was observed (93-96% at 24 h); 
      however, formation of 4-OH CTA was considerably lower (∼17.5% at 40 h), which is 
      consistent with 4-OH CTA being a highly reactive species. These data represent a 
      highly selective tissue-, species-, and sex-specific lesion in male CD-1 mice 
      associated with a cytotoxic metabolite product, 4-OH CTA. In humans, 
      glucuronidation of empagliflozin is the most prevalent metabolic pathway, and 
      oxidation is a minor pathway. Thus, renal toxicity due to the formation of 4-OH 
      CTA from empagliflozin is not expected in humans.

TI  - No Relevant Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Between the Sodium-Glucose 
      Co-Transporter-2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin and Lobeglitazone, a Peroxisome 
      Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ Agonist, in Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 1725-1734

AB  - PURPOSE: Combination therapy with insulin-independent sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitors and thiazolidinedione drugs, such as lobeglitazone, 
      has been reported to elicit potential additive efficacy in glycemic control in 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study was conducted to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and 
      lobeglitazone in healthy subjects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A randomized, 
      open-label, multiple-dose study was conducted in 30 healthy subjects using a 
      three-treatment, six-sequence, three-way crossover design. Subjects received one 
      of the following treatments once daily for 5 days in each period: 25 mg 
      empagliflozin, 0.5 mg lobeglitazone sulfate, or a combination. Serial blood 
      sampling before every dose and up to 24 h after the last dose was performed 
      during each treatment period. The PK parameters were estimated using 
      noncompartmental methods with the plasma empagliflozin and lobeglitazone 
      concentrations. The absence of a PK interaction was construed as the 90% 
      confidence interval (90% CI) of maximum concentration at steady state (C(max,ss)) 
      and area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC(tau)) 
      for combination therapy-to-monotherapy ratios within the limits of 0.80-1.25. 
      RESULTS: The steady-state plasma empagliflozin and lobeglitazone 
      concentration-time profiles of combination therapy and monotherapy were 
      comparable in the 25 subjects who completed the study. Coadministration of 
      empagliflozin with lobeglitazone did not affect empagliflozin PK (with 90% CIs of 
      0.956-1.150 and 0.945-1.133 for C(max,ss) and AUC(tau), respectively). Likewise, 
      empagliflozin did not affect lobeglitazone C(max,ss) or AUC(tau) (with 90% CIs of 
      0.869-0.995 and 0.851-1.018, respectively). All treatment groups tolerated mild 
      adverse events well. CONCLUSION: The lack of PK interactions between 
      lobeglitazone and empagliflozin in combination therapy, along with their good 
      tolerability, indicates that the two drugs can be coadministered without dose 
      adjustment. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02854748, Registered on August 7, 2016.

AB  - Empagliflozin is an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that 
      reduces hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by decreasing renal 
      glucose reabsorption and promoting urinary glucose excretion. In clinical trials, 
      empagliflozin demonstrated significant improvements in glycemic control, as 
      monotherapy and in combination regimens. In addition, empagliflozin was 
      associated with weight loss and moderate reductions in blood pressure. In the 
      EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of the 
      composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial 
      infarction and nonfatal stroke. Across the trials in general, empagliflozin was 
      well tolerated, with no increased risk of hypoglycemia except when used with an 
      insulin secretagogue or insulin. An increased risk of genital infections and 
      urinary tract infections has been reported, although the association is less 
      clear for urinary tract infections. Overall, empagliflozin appears to be a 
      promising treatment for T2DM.

TI  - Translational prediction of first-in-human pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
      of janagliflozin, a selective SGLT2 inhibitor, using allometric scaling, dedrick 
      and PK/PD modeling methods.

AB  - AIM: Janagliflozin is an orally selective SGLT2 inhibitor. To predict human 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) characteristics of janagliflozin. To 
      design optimal starting dose and effective dose for janagliflozin first-in-human 
      (FIH) study. METHODS: Animal PK/PD properties of janagliflozin were obtained from 
      preclinical in vivo and in vitro study. Pharmacologically effective level of same 
      class SGLT2 inhibitors were assessed through preclinical and clinical efficacy 
      data of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin. Human PK parameters and 
      profiles of janagliflozin were predicted by various methods such as allometric 
      scaling (AS), dedrick and PK/PD modeling analysis. Mechanistic PK/PD model was 
      developed to describe janagliflozin-mediated impact on urinary glucose excretion 
      (UGE). Human IC(50) was scaled from rat model-estimated IC(50) by correcting 
      interspecies difference of in vitro IC(50) and plasma f(u) of rat and human. The 
      quantitative PK/PD prediction of janagliflozin was evaluated via observed PK/PD 
      profiles of healthy subjects. Predicted PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin 
      were applied in FIH dose design. Optimal starting dose was suggested by 
      considering preclinical PD and toxicity data of janagliflozin. Effective dose was 
      suggested by considering pharmacologically effective level of same class drugs. 
      RESULTS: PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin in preclinical species were 
      summarized. Pharmacologically effective level for SGLT2 inhibitors was defined as 
      25~30% ΔUGE (ΔUGE=--(PG*GFR)(within24h)) based on efficacy data of three same 
      class drugs. Human predicted CL, V(ss) and F were 1.04 L/h, 77.5 L and 0.80. 
      Predicted AUC and C(max) of janagliflozin of 10 and 50 mg were within 0.47~2.08 
      fold of observed values. Predicted human UGE(0-)24 h and UGE(0-)144 h of 10 and 
      50 mg dose range were within 0.66~1.41 fold of observed values. Optimal starting 
      dose and pharmacologically active dose (PAD) were suggested as 10 mg and 50 mg. 
      Dose range for FIH study was designed as 10-450 mg. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      predicted human PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin based on preclinical data 
      and provide optimal dose design for janagliflozin FIH study based on 
      pharmacologically effective level of same class drugs.

TI  - Exposure-Response Analysis of the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors 
      Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin on Kidney Hemodynamics in Patients with Type 2 
      Diabetes.
LID - 10.3390/jpm13050747 [doi]

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve markers for renal and 
      cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). To 
      assess whether individual differences in plasma drug exposure can explain 
      inter-individual response variation, we characterized the exposure-response 
      relationship for two SGLT2 inhibitors on several clinical and kidney hemodynamic 
      variables. Data were obtained from two studies, RED and RECOLAR, assessing the 
      effects of once-daily 10 mg dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, respectively, on 
      kidney hemodynamics in patients with T2D. Individual plasma exposure was 
      estimated using non-compartmental analyses and exposure-response relationships 
      were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. In 23 patients participating in 
      RED, the dapagliflozin geometric mean apparent area under the concentration-time 
      curve during one dosing interval at steady state (AUC(0-tau,ss)) was 1153.1 
      µg/L*h (coefficient of variation (CV) 81.8%) and associated, per doubling, with 
      decreases in body weight (0.29 kg, p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (0.80 
      mmHg, p = 0.002), measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) (0.83 mL/min, p = 
      0.03), and filtration fraction (0.09%, p = 0.04). In 20 patients participating in 
      RECOLOR, the empagliflozin geometric mean AUC(0-tau,ss) was 2035.7 nmol/L*h (CV 
      48.4%) and associated, per doubling, with decreases in body weight (0.13 kg, p = 
      0.002), systolic blood pressure (0.65 mmHg, p = 0.045), and mGFR (0.78 mL/min, p 
      = 0.002). To conclude, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin plasma exposure was highly 
      variable between patients and associated with inter-individual variation in 
      response variables.

TI  - Structural repurposing of SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for strengthening 
      anti-heart failure activity with lower glycosuria.
PG  - 1671-1685
LID - 10.1016/j.apsb.2022.08.023 [doi]
AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been reapproved for heart 
      failure (HF) therapy in patients with and without diabetes. However, the initial 
      glucose-lowering indication of SGLT2i has impeded their uses in cardiovascular 
      clinical practice. A challenge of SGLT2i then becomes how to separate their 
      anti-HF activity from glucose-lowering side-effect. To address this issue, we 
      conducted structural repurposing of EMPA, a representative SGLT2 inhibitor, to 
      strengthen anti-HF activity and reduce the SGLT2-inhibitory activity according to 
      structural basis of inhibition of SGLT2. Compared to EMPA, the optimal derivative 
      JX01, which was produced by methylation of C2-OH of the glucose ring, exhibited 
      weaker SGLT2-inhibitory activity (IC(50) > 100 nmol/L), and lower glycosuria and 
      glucose-lowering side-effect, better NHE1-inhibitory activity and 
      cardioprotective effect in HF mice. Furthermore, JX01 showed good safety profiles 
      in respect of single-dose/repeat-dose toxicity and hERG activity, and good 
      pharmacokinetic properties in both mouse and rat species. Collectively, the 
      present study provided a paradigm of drug repurposing to discover novel anti-HF 
      drugs, and indirectly demonstrated that SGLT2-independent molecular mechanisms 
      play an important role in cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors.

TI  - Development and validation of Empagliflozin and Linagliptin simultaneous 
      estimation in rat plasma using freezing lipid precipitation and SCX-SPE assisted 
      HPLC-MS/MS method and its application in pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - 185-198
LID - 10.1007/s44211-023-00444-z [doi]
AB  - A quick and sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique was 
      designed, improved, and validated for simultaneous determination of Empagliflozin 
      (EPG) and Linagliptin (LNG) using Empagliflozin-d4 (EPG-d4) and linagliptin-d4 
      (LNG-d4) as internal standards (IS) in rat plasma. Target analytes and the IS 
      were extracted using freezing lipid precipitation (FLP) and optimized using the 
      strong cation exchange solid phase extraction (SCX-SPE) method to achieve the 
      maximum sample clean-up. In particular, when combined with SPE clean-up, FLP can 
      efficiently eliminate the plasma sample's high lipid content. More than 84.14% of 
      plasma lipids were rapidly removed during the FLP procedure, with minimal loss of 
      EPG and LNG. We used LC-atmospheric chemical ionization (APCI)-mass spectrometry 
      was employed to assess the efficiency of FLP in lipid removal. The SCX-SPE 
      cartridges removed the remaining impurities from EPG and LNG, allowing for 
      further purification. The samples were chromatographically separated using a 
      Spherisorb RP/Cyano column by pumping a gradient mobile phase comprised of 
      acetonitrile and 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 8.1) in positive ion mode at a 
      flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The selected reaction monitoring technique was performed 
      using a Waters triple-stage quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an 
      electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The chromatographic separation was 
      accomplished using a Waters Acquity® high-performance liquid chromatography 
      (HPLC) system. Mass transition (m/z) of 451.15/71.12 for EPG, m/z 473.27/419.94 
      for LNG; m/z 455.19/71.12 for EPG-d4, and 477.27/423.94 for LNG-d4 was 
      successfully achieved. This study successfully examined the concentration ranges 
      of 25-1050 ng/mL for EPG and 0.35-15 ng/mL for LNG. The results showed that the 
      linearity of EPG ranged from 25.14 to 985.26 ng/mL, while the linearity of LNG 
      ranged from 0.59 to 14.86 ng/mL. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for both 
      EPG and LNG, within and between days, were below 3.83%, indicating that they fall 
      within acceptable limits. This novel approach demonstrated favourable outcomes in 
      a pharmacokinetic study involving healthy rats, where EPG and LNG were 
      co-administered. This study found that the co-administration of both drugs did 
      not have a significant impact on their pharmacokinetic behavior, suggesting the 
      absence of any drug-drug interactions.

AB  - In type 2 diabetes (T2DM), glycaemic control delays the development and slows the 
      progression of complications. Although there are numerous glucose-lowering agents 
      in clinical use, only approximately half of T2DM patients achieve glycaemic 
      control, while undesirable side-effects, such as hypoglycaemia and body weight 
      gain, often impede treatment in those taking these medications. Thus, there is a 
      need for novel agents and treatment options. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
      inhibitors (SGLT-2-i) have recently been developed for the treatment of T2DM. The 
      available data suggest a good tolerability profile for the three available drugs 
      - canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin - approved by the US Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the American market as well as in other countries. 
      The most frequently reported adverse events with SGLT-2-i are female genital 
      mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and increased urination. The 
      pharmacodynamic response to SGLT-2-i declines with increasing severity of renal 
      impairment, requiring dosage adjustments or restrictions with moderate-to-severe 
      renal dysfunction. Most patients treated with SGLT-2-i also have a modest 
      reduction in blood pressure and modest effects on serum lipid profiles, some of 
      which are beneficial (increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and 
      decreased triglycerides) and others which are not (increased low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C). A number of large-scale and longer-term 
      cardiovascular trials are now ongoing. In patients treated with dapagliflozin, a 
      non-significant excess number of breast and bladder cancers has been reported; 
      considered as due to a bias, this is nevertheless being followed in the ongoing 
      trials. No other significant safety issues have been reported so far. Although 
      there is some benefit for several cardiovascular risk factors such as HbA1c, high 
      blood pressure, obesity and increases in LDL-C, adequately powered trials are 
      still required to determine the effects of SGLT-2-i on macrovascular outcomes.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become a growing epidemic and therefore efficient 
      treatment strategies that target its management are needed. The treatment of 
      diabetic patients often requires the combination of antidiabetic drug classes. 
      Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) block glucose reabsorption in 
      the proximal renal tubules. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) improve 
      glucose metabolism by blocking the enzyme that degrades incretins leading to 
      increased insulin secretion. Areas covered: The aim of the review is to present 
      the available data on pharmacokinetic properties/pharmacodynamics, metabolic and 
      cardiovascular effects of empagliflozin plus linagliptin combination. Expert 
      opinion: Both empagliflozin and linagliptin have established safety and efficacy 
      in the treatment of diabetes. Available data demonstrate the absence of 
      pharmacological interactions when the two drugs are given together. The 
      complementary mechanisms of action would be expected to provide additive benefits 
      on carbohydrate metabolism variables, but the results from clinical trials have 
      shown that the empagliflozin/linagliptin combination provides only mild 
      improvements of glycated hemoglobin compared with either monotherapy. However, 
      the single-tablet formulation of empagliflozin/linagliptin is expected to provide 
      better compliance and thus improved glycaemic control coupled with a favourable 
      safety profile. Thus, the fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin/linagliptin has 
      the capacity to both effectively and safely manage diabetic patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) is becoming a huge public health burden. New 
      diabetes drugs for type 2 diabetes (T2D), sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 
      inhibitors (SGLT2is), reduce the rate of hospitalization for HF in 
      placebo-controlled trials. AREAS COVERED: Pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin and 
      empagliflozin (in presence of renal impairment and hepatic dysfunction, two 
      comorbidities frequently associated with HF) and pharmacodynamic studies in 
      patients with HF. Main HF outcomes in T2D patients with cardiovascular risk and 
      in patients with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, with or 
      without T2D, from DAPA-HF, EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved original 
      findings and post hoc analyses. EXPERT OPINION: No clinically relevant changes 
      are expected concerning SGLT2i pharmacokinetics in patients with HF while 
      pharmacodynamic studies reported improvements in myocardium/vascular parameters, 
      biomarkers, and functional status. All SGLT2is showed a remarkable reduction in 
      hospitalization for HF in patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk. 
      Furthermore, both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin improved the prognosis of 
      patients with HFrEF, independently of the presence of T2D. Similar results were 
      reported with empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF, to be confirmed with 
      dapagliflozin in an ongoing trial (DELIVER). Thus, SGLT2is offer a new 
      opportunity for the prevention and management of HF in patients with or without 
      T2D.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter-2 inhibitor empagliflozin in young people with Type 2 diabetes: a 
      randomized trial.
PG  - 1096-1104
LID - 10.1111/dme.13629 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of a single dose 
      of empagliflozin in young people with Type 2 diabetes to identify the appropriate 
      doses for further paediatric development. METHODS: We conducted a single-dose, 
      open-label, randomized, parallel-group study with empagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg and 
      25 mg in young people with Type 2 diabetes aged 10-17 years. RESULTS: Of 39 
      participants screened, 27 were randomized and completed the study; their mean (± 
      sd) age was 14.1±2.0 years and body weight was 96.7±23.5 kg. Compared with 
      similar studies in adults with Type 2 diabetes, the maximum observed plasma 
      concentrations were slightly lower with the 10-mg and 25-mg doses, and the area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve was slightly lower with the 10-mg but 
      slightly higher with the 25-mg dose. The adjusted mean increases in urinary 
      glucose excretion were 53 g/24 h (95% CI 32,74), 73 g/24 h (95% CI 52,94) and 87 
      g/24 h (95% CI 68,107), and the adjusted mean decreases in fasting plasma glucose 
      were 0.9 mmol/l (95% CI -1.6,-0.1), 0.9 mmol/l (95% CI -1.7,-0.2) and 1.1 mmol/l 
      (95% CI -1.8,-0.5) for the 5- 10- and 25-mg doses, respectively. There were no 
      serious adverse events and one investigator-reported drug-related event 
      (dehydration). CONCLUSIONS: After a single oral dose of empagliflozin, adults and 
      young people with Type 2 diabetes had similar exposure-response relationships 
      after adjusting for significant covariates. These data support testing 10-mg 
      and/or 25-mg doses of empagliflozin in an upcoming paediatric phase III Type 2 
      diabetes trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no.: NCT02121483).

AB  - An efficient, accurate and sensitive spectrofluorimetric method was developed for 
      analysis of empagliflozin (EGF) in pure form, dosage form and human plasma. The 
      proposed procedure was based on formation of yellow fluorescent product between 
      benzofurazan reagent and empagliflozin in slightly alkaline medium that is 
      measured at 521 nm, when excitation at 455 nm. The present study was validated 
      according to ICH guidelines and bioanalytical validated according to US-FDA 
      guidance. The fluorescence intensity-concentration plot was linear over the range 
      of 50-1000 ng ml(-1) with limit of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) of 
      15.55 and 46.63 ng ml(-1), respectively. The correlation (r) and determination 
      (r(2)) coefficient was 0.9998 and 0.9997, respectively. Due to high sensitivity 
      and selectivity of the proposed method, it is successfully used for analysis of 
      empagliflozin in its dosage form and human plasma with good recoveries of 98.89% 
      and 98.70%, respectively, without any interfering from matrix components. The 
      corresponding regression equation, Y = 0.756X + 141.93, (r(2) = 0.9994) for 
      spiked plasma sample. Two level full factorial designs were used to study 
      different experimental parameters that affect the reaction product and to get the 
      optimum method conditions. The suggested method can be used in quality control 
      lab as well as in pharmacokinetic studies of empagliflozin.

      Dose-Dependent Glucosuria in Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 152-61
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.16 [doi]
AB  - Empagliflozin is an orally available, selective inhibitor of sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2. In this study, single oral doses of empagliflozin from 0.5 to 
      800 mg were not associated with any clinically significant safety concerns in 
      healthy male volunteers. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in 
      subjects receiving placebo (22.2%) or empagliflozin (25.0%) in the single rising 
      dose part of the study and after 50 mg empagliflozin under fed (28.6%) or fasted 
      (28.6%) conditions. The most frequent AE was headache. No clinically relevant 
      changes in laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were observed. 
      Single oral doses of empagliflozin were rapidly absorbed, reaching peak levels 
      after 1.0-2.1 hours. Increases in empagliflozin exposure were roughly 
      dose-proportional and a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion was 
      observed for empagliflozin doses up to 100 mg. After ingestion of 50 mg 
      empagliflozin in conjunction with a high-fat, high-calorie meal, no clinically 
      relevant changes in exposure were found, indicating that empagliflozin can be 
      administered independent of food. Empagliflozin up to 800 mg did not generate 
      clinically significant safety concerns in healthy male subjects. The 
      pharmacokinetic properties of empagliflozin support once daily administration 
      independent of food.

AB  - The two main sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), SGLT1 and SGLT2, provide new 
      therapeutic targets to reduce hyperglycaemia in patients with diabetes. SGLT1 
      enables the small intestine to absorb glucose and contributes to the reabsorption 
      of glucose filtered by the kidney. SGLT2 is responsible for reabsorption of most 
      of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibitors with varying specificities for 
      these transporters (eg, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin) can slow 
      the rate of intestinal glucose absorption and increase the renal elimination of 
      glucose into the urine. Results of randomised clinical trials have shown the 
      blood glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT inhibitors in type 2 diabetes when 
      administered as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering therapies 
      including insulin. Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss 
      and could help to reduce blood pressure. Effective SGLT2 inhibition needs 
      adequate glomerular filtration and might increase risk of urinary tract and 
      genital infection, and excessive inhibition of SGLT1 can cause gastro-intestinal 
      symptoms. However, the insulin-independent mechanism of action of SGLT inhibitors 
      seems to offer durable glucose-lowering efficacy with low risk of clinically 
      significant hypoglycaemia at any stage in the natural history of type 2 diabetes. 
      SGLT inhibition might also be considered in conjunction with insulin therapy in 
      type 1 diabetes.

TI  - A Review of the Safety and Efficacy of Bexagliflozin for the Management of Type 2 
      Diabetes.
PG  - 514-522

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology of bexagliflozin in addition to its safety 
      and efficacy from available clinical trials used for its approval, as well as 
      available clinical evidence to date. DATA SOURCES: A search of the National 
      Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and 
      PubMed database was performed from inception through June 1, 2023. STUDY 
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION QUANTIFICATION: The following study designs were 
      included: meta-analyses, systematic review, clinical trial, or observational 
      study design. Abstracts and drug monographs were also reviewed. Narrative or 
      scoping reviews were excluded. Only articles in the English language and those 
      evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, or efficacy of 
      bexaglifozin in humans were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bexagliflozin reduces 
      hemoglobin A1c ~0.5% with similar reductions in systolic blood pressure and body 
      weight to other SGLT2 inhibitors. No cardiovascular outcomes trial is published, 
      nor ongoing at this time. Adverse effects are similar to other SGLT2 inhibitors 
      (genital mycotic and urinary tract infections, increased urination) including a 
      warning for lower extremity amputation similar to canagliflozin. RELEVANCE TO 
      PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE IN COMPARISON TO EXISTING DRUGS: Although no 
      cost-effectiveness data are available, statements from the manufacturer suggest a 
      competitive price point. Given limited trial data, lower cost, if chosen, may 
      create a temporary niche for bexagliflozin pending generic availability of other 
      SGLT2 inhibitors. However, given lack of cardiovascular and renal outcome data, 
      empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or canagliflozin may be preferred. CONCLUSION: 
      Bexagliflozin appears safe and effective as monotherapy and add-on 
      pharmacological therapy for the treatment of T2D.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Empagliflozin in Healthy Egyptian Volunteers Using 
      LC-MS/MS and Comparison with Other Ethnic Populations.

AB  - The present study considered the pharmacokinetic evaluation of empagliflozin 
      after administration to Egyptian volunteers, and the results were compared with 
      other ethnic populations. The FDA recognizes that standard methods of defining 
      racial subgroups are necessary to compare results across pharmacokinetic studies 
      and to assess potential subgroup differences. The design of the study was as an 
      open labeled, randomized, one treatment, one period, single dose pharmacokinetic 
      study. The main pharmacokinetic parameters estimated were C(max), T(max), t(1/2), 
      elimination rate constant, AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-inf). The insignificant difference 
      in pharmacokinetic parameters between Egyptians and white German subjects 
      suggests that no dose adjustment should be considered with administration of 
      25 mg empagliflozin to Egyptian population. A new LC-MS/MS method was developed 
      and validated, allowing sensitive estimation of empagliflozin (25-600 ng mL(-1)) 
      in human plasma using dapagliflozin as an internal standard (IS). The method was 
      applied successfully on the underlying pharmacokinetic study with enhanced sample 
      preparation that involved liquid-liquid extraction. Multiple Reaction Monitoring 
      (MRM) of the transition pairs of m/z 449.01 to 371.21 for empagliflozin and m/z 
      407.00 to 328.81 for dapagliflozin (IS) was employed utilizing negative mode 
      Electro Spray Ionization (ESI). The validated LC-MS/MS method is suitable for 
      further toxicodynamic and bioequivalence studies.

      metabolic acidosis in type 2 diabetes.

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has risen in the United States 
      and worldwide, with an increase in global prevalence from 4.7% to 8.5% between 
      1980 and 2014. A variety of antidiabetic drugs are available with different 
      mechanisms of action, and multiple drugs are often used concomitantly to improve 
      glycemic control. One of the newest classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents is 
      the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or "flozins". Recent 
      clinical guidelines have suggested the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as add-on therapy 
      in patients for whom metformin alone does not achieve glycemic targets, or as 
      initial dual therapy with metformin in patients who present with higher glycated 
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The FDA has approved fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
      tablets with each of the three available SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin) and metformin. Both drug classes are associated 
      with the rare but serious life-threatening complications that result from 
      metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis (with metformin) and euglycemic 
      diabetic ketoacidosis (with SGLT2 inhibitors). This review summarizes the current 
      literature on the pharmacokinetics and the molecular targets of metformin and 
      SGLT2 inhibitors. It also addresses the common adverse effects and highlights the 
      molecular mechanisms by which this dual antihyperglycemic therapy contributes to 
      high anion gap metabolic acidosis. In conclusion, while the combination of 
      metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors would be a better option in improving glycemic 
      control with a low risk of hypoglycemia, an increase in the risk of metabolic 
      acidosis during combination therapy may be borne in mind.

TI  - Role of SLC5A2 polymorphisms and effects of genetic polymorphism on sodium 
      glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitorsinhibitor response.
PG  - 9637-9647
LID - 10.1007/s11033-023-08836-0 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disease characterized by 
      hyperglycaemia. T2DM is a highly heterogeneous polygenic disease. Due to genetic 
      variation, variations in lifestyle and other environmental exposures, there are 
      certain variations in the phenotype of T2DM patients. Sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are novel hypoglycaemic agents that increase 
      urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal 
      tubules of the kidney. For glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and 
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, studies have confirmed a variety of gene 
      variants that may modify their effects. For SGLT2 inhibitors, research has 
      focused on the SLC5A2 gene encoding SGLT2 and UGT1A9 gene polymorphisms affecting 
      SGLT2 inhibitor metabolism. The SLC5A2 polymorphism rs9934336 have been 
      associated with decreased HbA1c during the oral glucose tolerance test. Common 
      variants of the SLC5A2 gene are related to blood glucose and insulin 
      concentrations, but not glucagon concentrations. SLC5A2 rs9934336 and rs3116150 
      are related to a lower risk of heart failure. SGLT2 inhibitor exposure of 
      UGT1A9*3 carriers is commonly higher than that of noncarriers, while these 
      effects commonly have no obvious clinical significance on SGLT2 inhibitor 
      pharmacokinetics. In terms of efficacy, general SLC5A2 variants show no 
      significant effect on the response to the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin. At 
      present, research on the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and the 
      efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors is limited. The main purpose of this review is to 
      elucidate the general effects of SGLT2 polymorphisms and the association between 
      polymorphisms and the treatment response to SGLT2 inhibitors.

TI  - Assessing pharmacokinetic interactions between the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 
      inhibitor empagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide or torasemide in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, open-label, crossover study.

AB  - PURPOSE: Empagliflozin is a potent, selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 
      inhibitor approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thiazide or 
      loop diuretics are commonly prescribed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      This study investigated potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between 
      empagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or torasemide (TOR). METHODS: This 
      was an open-label, crossover study. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were 
      randomized to receive empagliflozin 25 mg once daily for 5 days and either HCTZ 
      25 mg once daily for 4 days followed by HCTZ 25 mg once daily plus empagliflozin 
      25 mg once daily for 5 days or TOR 5 mg once daily for 4 days followed by TOR 5 
      mg once daily plus empagliflozin once daily for 5 days in 1 of 4 sequences, with 
      at least a 7-day washout period between treatments. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      empagliflozin, HCTZ, and TOR were assessed and standard bioequivalence criteria 
      (80%-125%) were applied. Tolerability assessments included the frequency of 
      adverse events and an investigator assessment of global tolerability. FINDINGS: 
      Mean (SD) age of the 22 patients treated was 54.0 (8.1) years and body mass index 
      was 27.1 (3.7) kg/m(2). Coadministration of empagliflozin with HCTZ or TOR had no 
      effect on exposure to empagliflozin, HCTZ, or TOR. Geometric mean ratios (90% 
      CIs) for empagliflozin AUC over a uniform dosing interval and Cmax at steady 
      state were 107.1% (90% CI, 97.1-118.1) and 102.8% (90% CI, 88.6-119.3), 
      respectively, when coadministered with HCTZ versus administration alone, and 
      107.8% (90% CI, 100.1-116.1) and 107.5% (90% CI, 97.9-118.0), respectively, when 
      coadministered with TOR versus administration alone. For HCTZ, the geometric mean 
      ratios for AUC over a uniform dosing interval and Cmax at steady state were 96.3% 
      (90% CI, 89.1-104.0) and 101.8% (90% CI, 88.6-116.9), respectively, and for TOR 
      were 101.4% (90% CI, 99.1-103.9) and 104.4% (90% CI, 93.8-116.3), respectively, 
      for combined treatment versus administration alone. The pharmacokinetic profiles 
      of empagliflozin, HCTZ, and TOR were similar after administration alone and in 
      combination. Global tolerability was good for all patients after each treatment, 
      and no severe or serious adverse events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: No 
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was observed between empagliflozin and HCTZ 
      or TOR. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01276288.

TI  - Lack of drug-drug interaction between empagliflozin, a sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and warfarin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 316-23
LID - 10.1111/dom.12028 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate potential drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and 
      warfarin. METHODS: Healthy subjects (n = 18) received empagliflozin 25 mg qd for 
      5 days (treatment A), followed by empagliflozin 25 mg qd for 7 days (days 6-12) 
      with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin on day 6 (treatment B), and a single 25 mg 
      dose of warfarin alone (treatment C), in an open-label, crossover study. Subjects 
      received treatments in sequence AB_C or C_AB with a washout period of ≥14 days 
      between AB and C or C and AB. RESULTS: Warfarin had no effect on empagliflozin 
      area under concentration-time curve or maximum plasma concentration at 
      steady-state (AUC(τ,ss) or C(max,ss)): geometric mean ratios (GMRs) (90% 
      confidence intervals [CI]) were 100.89% (96.86, 105.10) and 100.64% (89.79, 
      112.80), respectively. Empagliflozin had no effect on AUC from 0 h to infinity 
      (AUC(0-∞)) or C(max) for R- or S-warfarin (GMRs [90% CI] for AUC(0-∞): 98.49% 
      [95.29, 101.80] and 95.88% [93.40, 98.43], respectively; C(max): 97.89% [91.12, 
      105.15] and 98.88% [91.84, 106.47], respectively). Empagliflozin had no 
      clinically relevant effects on warfarin's anticoagulant activity (international 
      normalised ratio [INR]) (GMR [95% CI] for peak INR: 0.87 [0.73, 1.04]; area under 
      the effect-time curve from 0 to 168 h: 0.88 [0.79, 0.98]. No drug-related adverse 
      events were reported for empagliflozin after monotherapy or combined 
      administration. The combination of empagliflozin and warfarin was well tolerated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: No drug-drug interactions were observed between empagliflozin and 
      warfarin, indicating that empagliflozin and warfarin can be co-administered 
      without dosage adjustments of either drug.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Characteristics and Clinical Efficacy of an SGLT2 Inhibitor Plus 
      DPP-4 Inhibitor Combination Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes.
PG  - 703-718
LID - 10.1007/s40262-016-0498-9 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) generally requires a combination of several pharmacological 
      approaches to control hyperglycaemia. Combining a sodium-glucose cotransporter 
      type 2 inhibitor (SGLT2I, also known as gliflozin) and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
      inhibitor (DPP-4I, also known as gliptin) appears to be an attractive strategy 
      because of complementary modes of action. This narrative review analyzes the 
      pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of different combined therapies with an 
      SGLT2I (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, 
      ipragliflozin, luseogliflozin, tofogliflozin) and DPP-4I (linagliptin, 
      saxagliptin, sitagliptin, teneligliptin). Drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction 
      studies do not show any significant changes in peak concentrations (C (max)) and 
      total exposure (area under the curve of plasma concentrations [AUC]) of either 
      drug when they were administered together orally compared with corresponding 
      values when each of them was absorbed alone. Two fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) 
      are already available (dapagliflozin-saxagliptin, empagliflozin-linagliptin) and 
      others are in development (ertugliflozin-sitagliptin). Preliminary results show 
      bioequivalence of the two medications administered as FDC tablets when compared 
      with coadministration of the individual tablets. Dual therapy is more potent than 
      either monotherapy in patients treated with diet and exercise or already treated 
      with metformin. SGLT2I and DPP-4I could be used as initial combination or in a 
      stepwise approach. The additional glucose-lowering effect appears to be more 
      marked when a gliflozin is added to a gliptin than when a gliptin is added to a 
      gliflozin. Combining the two pharmacological options is safe and does not induce 
      hypoglycaemia.

TI  - A potential novel treatment for cirrhosis-related ascites: Empagliflozin is safe 
      and tolerable in advanced chronic liver disease.
LID - 10.1111/bcp.16139 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Advanced chronic liver disease and advanced chronic liver disease-related 
      ascites have a high mortality. The pharmacological treatment of ascites and fluid 
      overload has changed little over time. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter type 2 inhibitor is an untested potential novel treatment in 
      cirrhosis, as it has survival benefits in heart failure, which has similar 
      pathophysiological fluid overload mechanisms. Before investigating 
      empagliflozin's potential benefit in cirrhosis, its safety must be addressed. 
      METHODS: Ten participants (five each with compensated or decompensated advanced 
      chronic liver disease, based on Child-Pugh class) received empagliflozin 10 mg 
      orally daily for 4 weeks with 2 weeks follow-up. Empagliflozin safety, 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated. RESULTS: In total, eight 
      patients (80%) reported an adverse event, and three patients (30%) experienced a 
      serious adverse event, one of which was attributed to empagliflozin. Overall, the 
      frequency of adverse events was similar to previous phase 3 trials of gliflozins. 
      Higher plasma empagliflozin concentrations did not significantly increase the 
      risk of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Four-week treatment with empagliflozin was 
      safe and well tolerated in patients with advanced chronic liver disease. These 
      preliminary data support assessment of long-term treatment on disease-related and 
      mortality outcomes in patients with cirrhosis through randomized control trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is a potent, oral, selective inhibitor of sodium 
      glucose cotransporter 2 in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. OBJECTIVE: The goal of these studies was to investigate potential 
      drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and gemfibrozil (an organic 
      anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 [OATP1B1]/1B3 and organic anion transporter 3 
      [OAT3] inhibitor), rifampicin (an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor), or probenecid (an OAT3 
      and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase inhibitor). METHODS: Two 
      open-label, randomized, crossover studies were undertaken in healthy subjects. In 
      the first study, 18 subjects received the following in 1 of 2 randomized 
      treatment sequences: a single dose of empagliflozin 25 mg alone and gemfibrozil 
      600 mg BID for 5 days with a single dose of empagliflozin 25 mg on the third day. 
      In the second study, 18 subjects received a single dose of empagliflozin 10 mg, a 
      single dose of empagliflozin 10 mg coadministered with a single dose of 
      rifampicin 600 mg, and probenecid 500 mg BID for 4 days with a single dose of 
      empagliflozin 10 mg on the second day in 1 of 6 randomized treatment sequences. 
      RESULTS: In the gemfibrozil study, 11 subjects were male, mean age was 35.1 years 
      and mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.47 kg/m(2). In the rifampicin/probenecid 
      study, 10 subjects were male, mean age was 32.7 years and mean BMI was 23.03 
      kg/m(2). Exposure to empagliflozin was increased by coadministration with 
      gemfibrozil (AUC0-∞: geometric mean ratio [GMR], 158.50% [90% CI, 151.77-165.53]; 
      Cmax: GMR, 115.00% [90% CI, 106.15-124.59]), rifampicin (AUC0-∞: GMR, 135.20% 
      [90% CI, 129.58-141.06]; Cmax: GMR, 175.14% [90% CI, 160.14-191.56]), and 
      probenecid (AUC0-∞: GMR, 153.47% [90% CI, 146.41-160.88]; Cmax: GMR, 125.60% [90% 
      CI, 113.67-138.78]). All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Increases 
      in empagliflozin exposure were <2-fold, indicating that the inhibition of the 
      OATP1B1/1B3, OAT3 transporter, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases 
      did not have a clinically relevant effect on empagliflozin exposure. No dose 
      adjustments of empagliflozin were necessary when it was coadministered with 
      gemfibrozil, rifampicin, or probenecid. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: 
      NCT01301742 and NCT01634100.

TI  - Combined experimental/computational aspects for the molecular interaction of 
      empagliflozin with bovine serum albumin: Quantification and application to human 
      plasma.
PG  - 1449-1457
LID - 10.1002/bio.4526 [doi]
AB  - Empagliflozin (EMP) is an oral antihyperglycemic agent for type 2 diabetic 
      patients. The molecular binding of EMP to bovine serum albumin (BSA) was 
      elucidated by a combined experimental/computational approach to fulfil the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics gaps of the cited drug for further 
      development. Fluorescence, synchronous, and three-dimensional fluorescence 
      spectroscopy verified that EMP quenched BSA native fluorescence through a dual 
      static/dynamic mechanism that was further supported by Fӧrster resonance energy 
      transfer and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared 
      spectroscopy revealed the conformational variations in BSA secondary structure 
      induced by EMP. Thermodynamic properties of the BSA-EMP complex were also 
      investigated, and the hydrophobic interactions' role in the binding process was 
      demonstrated by the computed enthalpy (ΔH = 6.558 kJ mol(-1) ) and entropy 
      (ΔS = 69.333 J mol(-1)  K(-1) ). Gibbs free energy (ΔG) values were negative at 
      three distinct temperatures, illuminating the spontaneity of this interaction. In 
      addition, molecular docking studies depicted the optimal fitting of EMP to BSA on 
      Site I (sub-domain IIA) through three hydrogen bonds. Additionally, and based on 
      the quenching effect of EMP on BSA fluorescence, this study suggests a simple 
      validated spectrofluorometric method for the quantitation of the studied drug in 
      bulk form and human plasma samples with reasonable recoveries (96.99-103.10%).

AB  - Sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, also known as gliflozins, are a 
      new class of orally active drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes. By 
      inhibiting the SGLT responsible for the reabsorption of glucose from the kidney, 
      their use aims primarily to induce glycosuria and, as a consequence, lower 
      glycemic levels. However, their specific mechanism of action involves other 
      pharmacodynamic consequences including potentially harmful adverse reactions. 
      This manuscript reviews the physiological and pharmacological background behind 
      inhibition of SGLTs, and discusses the pharmacological aspects of the safety of 
      gliflozins.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, 
      pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, tolerability, dosing, drug interactions, and 
      administration of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin, and comparing 
      the benefit and risk aspects of using these agents in the older adult diabetes 
      patient population. DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, AND DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: A search of PubMed using the terms "SGLT-2 inhibitors," 
      "canagliflozin," "dapagliflozin," "empagliflozin," "efficacy," and "tolerability" 
      was performed to find relevant primary literature on each of the sodium/glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors currently approved for use in type 2 
      diabetes. Phase III trials for all agents were included. All English-language 
      articles from 2010 to 2015 appearing in these searches were reviewed for 
      relevance to this paper. In addition, related articles suggested in the PubMed 
      search were also reviewed. The SGLT-2 inhibitors have shown a reduction in 
      hemoglobin A1c values and fasting plasma glucose levels with a low incidence of 
      hypoglycemia. The incidence of mycotic infections is increased in patients taking 
      an SGLT-2 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: SGLT-2 inhibitors may be a viable treatment 
      option for patients not controlled on other oral agents. The risk of hypoglycemia 
      is small. However, the clinical efficacy and tolerability of these agents has not 
      been fully elucidated in older and frail patients.

AB  - Data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple oral dose studies of 
      empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; N = 974; 1-100 mg 
      q.d.; ≤12 weeks) were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for 
      empagliflozin. The model consisted of two-compartmental disposition, lagged 
      first-order absorption and first-order elimination, and incorporated appropriate 
      covariates. Population estimates (interindividual variance, CV%) of oral apparent 
      clearance, central and peripheral volumes of distribution, and 
      inter-compartmental clearance were 9.87 L/h (26.9%), 3.02 L, 60.4 L (30.8%), and 
      5.16 L/h, respectively. An imposed allometric weight effect was the most 
      influential PK covariate effect, with a maximum effect on exposure of ±30%, using 
      2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of observed weights, relative to the median observed 
      weight. Sex and race did not lend additional description to PK variability beyond 
      allometric weight effects, other than ∼25% greater oral absorption rate constant 
      for Asian patients. Age, total protein, and smoking/alcohol history did not 
      affect PK parameters. Predictive check plots were consistent with observed data, 
      implying an adequate description of empagliflozin PKs following multiple dosing 
      in patients with T2DM. The lack of marked covariate effects, including weight, 
      suggests that no exposure-based dose adjustments were required within the study 
      population and dose range.

AB  - Management of hypertension in diabetes is critical for reduction of 
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. While blood pressure (BP) control has 
      improved over the past two decades, the control rate is still well below 50% in 
      the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A new 
      class of oral glucose-lowering agents has recently been approved; the 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which act by eliminating 
      large amounts of glucose in the urine. Two agents, dapagliflozin and 
      canagliflozin, are currently approved in the United States and Europe, and 
      empagliflozin and ipragliflozin have reported Phase 3 trials. In addition to 
      glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with weight loss and act as 
      osmotic diuretics, resulting in a lowering of BP. While not approved for 
      BP-lowering, they may potentially aid BP goal achievement in people within 7-10 
      mm Hg of goal. It should be noted that the currently approved agents have side 
      effects that include an increased incidence of genital infections, predominantly 
      in women. The approved SGLT2 inhibitors have limited use based on kidney function 
      and should be used only in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for dapagliflozin and ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 
      canagliflozin. Cardiovascular outcome trials are ongoing with these agents and 
      will be completed within the next 4-5 years.

TI  - Cubosomal functionalized block copolymer platform for dual delivery of 
      linagliptin and empagliflozin: Recent advances in synergistic strategies for 
      maximizing control of high-risk type II diabetes.
PG  - 678-695
LID - 10.1007/s13346-023-01423-7 [doi]
AB  - A well-made chitosan-PVP block copolymer platform was equipped with highly 
      ordered and uniform nano-channels. This highly adhesive block copolymer platform 
      was designed to ensure the efficient co-delivery of two synergistic-acting 
      hypoglycemic drugs. Linagliptin oral bioavailability is 30% due to poor 
      permeability and intestinal degradation. Its pharmacokinetics shows a non-linear 
      profile. Empagliflozin exhibited decreased permeability and decreased solubility 
      in aqueous media between pH 1 and 7.5. Cubosomes were functionalized as a good 
      microdomain to guest and improve the physicochemical characteristics of drug 
      molecules with decreased permeability and solubility. Cubosomes loaded with 
      linagliptin (linagliptin cubosomes (LCs)) and empagliflozin (empagliflozin 
      cubosomes ECs) were separately prepared using the top-down method and optimized 
      by applying 2(3) factorial design. Optimized cubosomal systems LCs (F3) and ECs 
      (F4) were incorporated into a chitosan-PVP gel to obtain dual cubosome-loaded 
      platforms (LECF) optimized through 2(2) factorial design. The permeation study 
      from the optimized LECF (C1) ensured enhanced empagliflozin permeation alongside 
      continued efflux for linagliptin, resolving potential risks due to its non-linear 
      plasma profile. The in-vivo study revealed that AUC((0-∞)) of linagliptin and 
      empagliflozin was enhanced by 2- and threefold, respectively. Therefore, the 
      chitosan-PVP block copolymer platform buccal application for the co-delivery of 
      linagliptin and empagliflozin could contribute to enhanced clinical effectiveness 
      in treating diabetes.

AB  - Empagliflozin (EM) was successfully loaded in polycaprolactone/poly (L-lactic 
      acid)/polymethyl methacrylate (PCL/PLA/PMMA) fibers. In the rat β-cell line 
      (BRIN-BD11), the insulin expression ratio of pancreatic β-cells was stimulated at 
      high and low glucose by culturing with tri-layer EM-loaded fiber (EMF) for 48 h. 
      The expression ratios of glucokinase and GLUT-2 proteins increased after EMF 
      treatment. According to the in vitro drug release test, 97% of all drug contained 
      in fibers was released in a controlled manner for 24 h. The pharmacokinetic test 
      revealed that the bioavailability was improved ∼4.8-fold with EMF treatment 
      compared to EM-powder and blood glucose level was effectively controlled for 24 h 
      with EMF. Oral administration of EMF exhibited a better sustainable anti-diabetic 
      activity even in the half-dosage than EM-powder in 
      streptozotocin/nicotinamide-induced T2DM rats. The levels of GLP-1, PPAR-γ, and 
      insulin were increased while the levels of SGLT-2 and TNF-α were decreased with 
      EMF treatment. Also, EMF recovered the histopathological changes in the liver, 
      pancreas, and kidney in T2DM rats and protected pancreatic β-cells. Consequently, 
      EMF is suggested as an unprecedented and promotive treatment approach for T2DM 
      with a higher bioavailability and better antidiabetic effect compared to 
      conventional dosage forms.

AB  - Diabetes, characterized by high glucose levels, has been listed to be one of the 
      world's major causes of death. Around 1.6 million deaths are attributed to this 
      disease each year. Persistent hyperglycemic conditions in diabetic patients 
      affect various organs of the body leading to diabetic complications and worsen 
      the disease condition. Current treatment strategies for diabetes include 
      biguanides, sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, 
      insulin and its analogs, DPP-4(dipeptidyl peptidase-4) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like 
      peptide) analogs. However, many side effects contributing to the devastation of 
      the disease are associated with them. Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibition has been reported to be new insulin-independent approach to diabetes 
      therapy. It blocks glucose uptake in the kidneys by inhibiting SGLT2 
      transporters, thereby promoting glycosuria. Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and 
      canagliflozin are the most widely used SGLT2 inhibitors. They are effective in 
      controlling blood glucose and HbA1c levels with few side effects including 
      hypoglycemia or weight gain which makes them preferable to other anti-diabetic 
      drugs. However, treatment is found to be associated with inter-individual drug 
      response to SGLT2 inhibitors and adverse drug reactions which are also affected 
      by genetic variations. There have been very few pharmacogenetics trials of these 
      drugs. This review discusses the various SGLT2 inhibitors, their 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and genetic variation influencing the 
      inter-individual drug response.

AB  - A simple, economic, green, and sensitive bioanalytical method for empagliflozin 
      bioassay in rats' plasma was employed successfully owing to the empagliflozin 
      native fluorescence behavior. Enhanced liquid-liquid extraction, using diethyl 
      ether (DEE), was successfully employed for the improved extraction of 
      empagliflozin from rats' plasma based on its high value of logP as 1.8 that 
      boosted the drug migration from plasma to the organic layer. The relative 
      fluorescence intensity for empagliflozin was recorded at emission (299.4 nm) 
      after excitation at 226.5 nm. The method was validated with satisfactory results 
      for linearity (500-5000 ng/mL), trueness, precision, the matrix effect, and 
      extraction recovery. The matrix effect ranged between 15.63% and 23.10% for LQC 
      and HQC samples, respectively. Extraction recovery ranged between 54.61% and 
      62.54% for LQC and HQC samples, respectively. Bias values for the trueness ranged 
      between -10.62 and +14.95, while %RSD values for the precision ranged between 
      5.39% and 9.33%. The method was successfully applied to rats' plasma samples that 
      included six rats, and the drug concentration was determined in their plasma 
      after 1 hour (estimated Cmax based on literature) following oral administration 
      of empagliflozin with a concentration of 10 mg/Kg, p.o.. The developed 
      cost-effective spectrofluorimetric method in the present work will be of 
      beneficial use in further pharmacokinetic studies that include rats' plasma and 
      biological fluids. Moreover, with the suitable modifications, the described novel 
      extraction of empagliflozin could be adopted to human plasma samples and future 
      clinical studies. Moreover, development of new simple cost-effective methods is 
      necessary to give the researchers a set of "varieties" that they can use 
      according to the laboratory limitations, especially in the developing countries 
      in addition of being a greener method due to the lower consumption of toxic 
      solvents and lower waste production.

TI  - Empagliflozin: a new sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 212262
LID - 10.7573/dic.212262 [doi]
LID - 212262
AB  - Type 2 diabetes is increasing in prevalence worldwide, and hyperglycemia is often 
      poorly controlled despite a number of therapeutic options. Unlike previously 
      available agents, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors offer an 
      insulin-independent mechanism for improving blood glucose levels, since they 
      promote urinary glucose excretion (UGE) by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the 
      kidney. In addition to glucose control, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with 
      weight loss and blood pressure reductions, and do not increase the risk of 
      hypoglycemia. Empagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of SGLT2, providing 
      dose-dependent UGE increases in healthy volunteers, with up to 90 g of glucose 
      excreted per day. It can be administered orally, and studies of people with renal 
      or hepatic impairment indicated empagliflozin needed no dose adjustment based on 
      pharmacokinetics. In Phase II trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, 
      empagliflozin provided improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and other 
      measures of glycemic control when given as monotherapy or add-on to metformin, as 
      well as reductions in weight and systolic blood pressure. As add-on to basal 
      insulin, empagliflozin not only improved HbA1c levels but also reduced insulin 
      doses. Across studies, empagliflozin was generally well tolerated with a similar 
      rate of hypoglycemia to placebo; however, patients had a slightly increased 
      frequency of genital infections, but not urinary tract infections, versus 
      placebo. Phase III studies have also reported a good safety profile along with 
      significant improvements in HbA1c, weight and blood pressure, with no increased 
      risk of hypoglycemia versus placebo. Based on available data, it appears that 
      empagliflozin may be a useful option in a range of patients; however, clinical 
      decisions will be better informed by the results of ongoing studies, in 
      particular, a large cardiovascular outcome study (EMPA-REG OUTCOME™).

TI  - Liquid chromatographic and spectrofluorimetric assays of empagliflozin: Applied 
      to degradation kinetic study and content uniformity testing.
PG  - 919-932
LID - 10.1002/bio.3491 [doi]
AB  - Stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
      spectrofluorimetric methods were developed for determination of empagliflozin 
      (EGF). EGF was subjected to oxidation, wet heat, photo-degradation, acid 
      hydrolysis and alkali hydrolysis. The alkaline degradation pathway was subjected 
      to a kinetics study as the major product obtained after stress conditions. 
      Arrhenius plots were constructed and the activation energies of the degradation 
      process were calculated. HPLC was used for the kinetic study as it enabled 
      simultaneous determination of EGF and the degradation product while the 
      spectrofluorimetric assay was applied to content uniformity testing due to its 
      higher sensitivity and lower limit of detection (LOD). Isocratic chromatographic 
      elution was attained for HPLC on a Intersil® C(18) column (150 mm × 4 mm, 5 μm), 
      using a mobile phase of acetonitrile-potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer pH 4, 
      (50:50, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with ultraviolet (UV) detection at 
      225 nm. The relative fluorescence intensity was recorded by spectrofluorimeter 
      applying synchronous mode using ∆λ = 70 nm at 297.6 nm. Linearity ranges were 
      found to be 5-50 μg/ml and 50-1000 ng/ml for HPLC and spectrofluorimetric 
      methods, respectively.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are filtered and secreted to 
      their primary site of action in the proximal tubule of the kidney. At this site, 
      SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce renal elimination of ketone bodies, a finding 
      implicated in their propensity to cause ketoacidosis. Many commonly used 
      medications have potential to diminish renal elimination of SGLT2 inhibitors and 
      to compound the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal elimination of ketone bodies 
      by inhibiting tubular secretion of the SGLT2 inhibitor itself and/or ketone 
      bodies. We present a case of severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in a patient with 
      type 2 diabetes occurring several days after co-prescription of empagliflozin and 
      probenecid. Other than the recent introduction of empagliflozin, no cause for the 
      DKA episode was apparent. A pharmacokinetic interaction between probenecid and 
      empagliflozin, involving organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), reduces proximal 
      tubular secretion of empagliflozin and increases patient exposure to the drug. 
      Whether or not this phenomenon is sufficient to cause severe DKA is discussed. An 
      alternative explanation as to the DKA aetiology is proposed, wherein probenecid 
      may compound effects of empagliflozin on renal elimination of ketone bodies. We 
      suggest that clinicians exercise caution when prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors 
      alongside pharmacologic inhibitors of, or competitors for, proximal tubular 
      organic anion transporters in patients with diabetes mellitus due to the risk of 
      severe DKA.

TI  - Mode of action and human relevance assessment of male CD-1 mouse renal

AB  - Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) has been shown to be a safe 
      and efficacious approach to support managing Type 2 diabetes. In the 2-year 
      carcinogenicity study with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in CD-1 mice, an 
      increased incidence of renal tubular adenomas and carcinomas was identified in 
      the male high-dose group but was not observed in female mice. An integrated 
      review of available nonclinical data was conducted to establish a mode-of-action 
      hypothesis for male mouse-specific tumorigenesis. Five key events were identified 
      through systematic analysis to form the proposed mode-of-action: (1) Background 
      kidney pathology in CD-1 mice sensitizes the strain to (2) pharmacology-related 
      diuretic effects associated with SGLT2 inhib ition. (3) In male mice, metabolic 
      demand increases with the formation of a sex- and species-specific empagliflozin 
      metabolite. These features converge to (4) deplete oxidative stress handling 
      reserve, driving (5) constitutive cellular proliferation in male CD-1 mice. The 
      proposed mode of action requires all five key events for empagliflozin to present 
      a carcinogenicity risk in the CD-1 mouse. Considering that empagliflozin is not 
      genotoxic in the standard battery of genotoxicity tests, and not all five key 
      events are present in the context of female mice, rats, or humans, nor for other 
      osmotic diuretics or other SGLT2 inhibitors, the observed male mouse renal tumors 
      are not considered relevant to humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor in 
      clinical development as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVE: The 
      goal of this study was to investigate potential drug-drug interactions between 
      empagliflozin and verapamil, ramipril, and digoxin in healthy volunteers. 
      METHODS: The potential drug-drug interactions were evaluated in 3 separate 
      trials. In the first study, 16 subjects were randomized to receive single-dose 
      empagliflozin 25 mg alone or single-dose empagliflozin 25 mg with single-dose 
      verapamil 120 mg. In the second study, 23 subjects were randomized to receive 
      empagliflozin 25 mg once daily (QD) for 5 days, ramipril (2.5 mg on day 1 then 5 
      mg QD on days 2-5) for 5 days or empagliflozin 25 mg with ramipril (2.5 mg on day 
      1 then 5 mg QD on days 2-5) for 5 days. In the third study, 20 subjects were 
      randomized to receive single-dose digoxin 0.5 mg alone or empagliflozin 25 mg QD 
      for 8 days with single-dose digoxin 0.5 mg on day 5. RESULTS: Exposure of 
      empagliflozin was not affected by coadministration with verapamil (AUC0-∞: 
      geometric mean ratio [GMR], 102.95%; 90% CI, 98.87-107.20; Cmax: GMR, 92.39%; 90% 
      CI, 85.38-99.97) or ramipril (AUC over a uniform dosing interval τ at steady 
      state [AUCτ,ss]: GMR, 96.55%; 90% CI, 93.05-100.18; Cmax at steady state 
      [Cmax,ss]: GMR, 104.47%; 90% CI 97.65-111.77). Empagliflozin had no clinically 
      relevant effect on exposure of ramipril (AUCτ,ss: GMR, 108.14%; 90% CI 
      100.51-116.35; Cmax,ss: GMR, 103.61%; 90% CI, 89.73-119.64) or its active 
      metabolite ramiprilat (AUCτ,ss: GMR, 98.67%; 90% CI, 96.00-101.42; Cmax,ss: GMR, 
      98.29%; 90% CI, 92.67-104.25). Coadministration of empagliflozin had no 
      clinically meaningful effect on digoxin AUC0-∞ (GMR, 106.11%; 90% CI, 
      96.71-116.41); however, a slight increase in Cmax was observed that was not 
      considered clinically relevant (GMR, 113.94%; 90% CI, 99.33-130.70). All 
      treatments were well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events or adverse 
      events leading to discontinuation in any of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: No dose 
      adjustment of empagliflozin is required when coadministered with ramipril or 
      verapamil, and no dose adjustment of digoxin or ramipril is required when 
      coadministered with empagliflozin. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01306175 
      (digoxin), NCT01276301 (verapamil), and NCT01284621 (ramipril).

      information for primary care providers.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) and elevates individuals' risk for cardiovascular disease, the 
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality in T2DM. Achieving and maintaining tight 
      glycemic control is key to preventing development or progression of CKD; however, 
      improving glycemic control may be limited by effects of renal impairment on the 
      efficacy and safety of T2DM treatments, necessitating dosing adjustments and 
      careful evaluation of contraindications. Understanding the treatment 
      considerations specific to each class of T2DM medication is important in 
      individualizing therapy and improving glycemic, renal, and cardiovascular 
      outcomes. Traditional glucose-lowering treatments include insulin, metformin, 
      sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones. Each of these agents 
      exhibits altered pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment except for 
      the thiazolidinediones, which are metabolized by the liver and do not accumulate 
      appreciably in patients with renal impairment. Newer glucose-lowering treatments 
      include GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors. Of 
      these, only the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin can be used across all stages of 
      renal impairment without dosing restrictions or concerns regarding dose 
      escalation, and all SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated when eGFR 
      <45 mL/min/1.73m(2). Several of the newer treatments have also been investigated 
      for effects on renal and cardiovascular outcomes, demonstrating potential 
      benefits of the GLP-1 agonists liraglutide and semaglutide, as well as the SGLT2 
      inhibitors canagliflozin and empagliflozin, in reducing risk for some adverse 
      renal and cardiovascular events. In addition, some DPP-4 inhibitors have been 
      shown to reduce albuminuria, an indicator of glomerular dysfunction. 
      Consideration of this information is useful in informing optimal management 
      strategies for patients with T2DM and concomitant CKD. More clinical data from 
      future and ongoing clinical trials, including data regarding potential renal and 
      cardiovascular benefits, will be important in clarifying the safety and efficacy 
      profiles of each of these agents in patients with CKD.

TI  - DPP-4 inhibitor plus SGLT-2 inhibitor as combination therapy for type 2 diabetes: 
      from rationale to clinical aspects.
PG  - 1407-1417
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease with multiple defects, which generally 
      require a combination of several pharmacological approaches to control 
      hyperglycemia. Combining a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) and a 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor (SGT2i) appears to be an attractive 
      approach. Area covered: An extensive literature search was performed to analyze 
      the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical experience of different 
      gliptin-gliflozin combinations. Expert opinion: There is a strong rationale for 
      combining a DPP-4i and a SGLT2i in patients with T2D because the two drugs exert 
      different and complementary glucose-lowering effects. Dual therapy (initial 
      combination or stepwise approach) is more potent than either monotherapy in 
      patients treated with diet and exercise or already treated with metformin. 
      Combining the two pharmacological options is safe and does not induce 
      hypoglycemia. The additional glucose-lowering effect is more marked when a 
      gliflozin is added to a gliptin than when a gliptin is added to a gliflozin. Two 
      fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) are already available (saxagliptin-dapagliflozin 
      and linagliptin-empagliflozin) and others are in current development. 
      Bioequivalence of the two compounds given as FDC tablets was demonstrated when 
      compared with coadministration of the individual tablets. FDCs could simplify the 
      anti-hyperglycaemic therapy and improve drug compliance.

TI  - Low-dose empagliflozin as adjunct-to-insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes: A valid 
      modelling and simulation analysis to confirm efficacy.
PG  - 427-433
LID - 10.1111/dom.13945 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To confirm the observed reduction in HbA1c for the 2.5 mg dose in EASE-3 by 
      modelling and simulation analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Independent of data 
      from EASE-3 that tested 2.5 mg, we simulated the effect of a 2.5 mg dose through 
      patient-level, exposure-response modelling in the EASE-2 clinical study. A 
      primary semi-mechanistic model evaluated efficacy considering clinical insulin 
      dose adjustments made after treatment initiation that potentially limited HbA1c 
      reductions. The model was informed by pharmacokinetic, insulin dose, mean daily 
      glucose and HbA1c data, and was verified by comparing the simulations with the 
      observed HbA1c change in EASE-3. One of two empagliflozin phase 3 trials in type 
      1 diabetes (EASE-3 but not EASE-2) included a lower 2.5 mg dose. A 
      placebo-corrected HbA1c reduction of 0.28% was demonstrated without the increased 
      risk of diabetic ketoacidosis observed at higher doses (10 mg and 25 mg). Since 
      only one trial included the lower dose, we aimed to confirm the observed 
      reduction in HbA1c for the 2.5 mg dose by modelling and simulation analyses. 
      RESULTS: The simulated 26-week mean HbA1c change was -0.41% without insulin dose 
      adjustment and -0.29% at 26 weeks with insulin dose adjustment. A simplified 
      (descriptive) model excluding insulin dose and mean daily glucose confirmed the 
      -0.29% HbA1c change that would have been observed had the EASE-2 population 
      received a 2.5 mg dose for 26/52 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The HbA1c benefit of 
      low-dose empagliflozin directly observed in the EASE-3 trial was confirmed by two 
      modelling and simulation approaches.

TI  - Discerning computational, in vitro and in vivo investigations of self-assembling 
      empagliflozin polymeric micelles in type-2 diabetes.
LID - 10.1007/s13346-024-01658-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin (EMPA) is an SGLT2 inhibitor, a new class of 
      anti-diabetic medication, indicated for treating type-2 diabetes. Its low 
      permeability, poor solubility and bioavailability limits its use in management of 
      diabetes. The study was aimed to formulate EMPA loaded polymeric micelles (PMs) 
      to overcome these obstacles in oral absorption. METHODOLOGY: In silico 
      studies-molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation (MDS), and quantum 
      chemical calculation were employed to study the interaction of EMPA with 
      different polymers. EMPA loaded TPGS polymeric micelles (EMPA-TPGS-PMs) were 
      formulated by direct dissolution method and characterized in terms of surface 
      morphology, entrapment, particle size, in vitro drug release, and in vitro 
      cytotoxicity (HEK293 cells). In vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies 
      were also performed. RESULTS: The results suggested a good interaction between 
      TPGS and EMPA with lowest binding energy compared to other polymers. Further MDS 
      results and DFT calculations validated the stable binding of the complex hence 
      TPGS was selected for further wet lab experiments. The EMPA-TPGS complex 
      displayed lower value of Total energy (T.E.) than its individual components, 
      indicating the overall stability of the complex while, the energy band gap (∆E) 
      value lied between the two individual molecules, signifying the better electron 
      transfer between HOMO and LUMO of the complex. Based on the solubility, 
      entrapment and cytotoxicity studies, 5% TPGS was selected for formulating drug 
      loaded micelles. EMPA-TPGS5-PMs presented a size of 9.008 ± 1.25 nm, 
      Polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.254 ± 0.100, a controlled release behaviour upto 
      24 h. SEM and AFM images of the nanoformulation suggested spherical particles 
      whereas, DSC, and PXRD studies confirmed the loss of crystallinity of EMPA. A 
      3.12-folds higher AUC and a greater reduction in blood glucose levels was 
      exhibited by EMPA-TPGS5-PMs in comparison to EMPA-SUSP in mice model. CONCLUSION: 
      EMPA-TPGS-PMs has exhibited better bio absorption and therapeutic effectiveness 
      in diabetes treatment. This improved performance would open the possibility of 
      dose reduction, reduced dosing frequency & dose-related side effects, improving 
      pharmaco-economics and thereby improved overall compliance to the patient. 
      However, this translation from bench to bedside would necessitate studies in 
      higher animals and human volunteers.

AB  - Nanosponges are porous solid nanoparticles composed of hyper-cross-linked 
      polymers that serve as specific micro-domains designed for the co-encapsulation 
      of two drugs with different chemical structures. Our goal was to engineer a novel 
      assembly of multilayer nanosponges (MLNS) based on a layer-by-layer approach. 
      This MLNS was engineered to incorporate two drugs (linagliptin and empagliflozin) 
      in a new drug delivery route. Linagliptin has a low oral bioavailability due to 
      intestinal degradation and low permeability. Its pharmacokinetics shows a 
      non-linear profile which leads to a disproportionate increase in its 
      effectiveness with increasing the dose frequency. Empagliflozin has a low 
      permeability and is very slightly soluble in aqueous media between pH 1-7.5. MLNS 
      could improve their bioavailability along with resolving possible risks due to 
      the non-linear pharmacokinetics of linagliptin and maximizing its dose 
      efficiency. 2(3) factorial design was used to optimize the novel systems. MLNS 
      (F4) was chosen as the optimal system with an average diameter of 40 nm and the 
      highest entrapment efficiency which accounts for 92.93 % ± 2.27 and 
      100.94 % ± 0.55 for linagliptin and empagliflozin respectively. Förster resonance 
      energy transfer confirmed the formation of a multilayer structure in MLNS. The 
      optimized system was incorporated within chitosan mucoadhesive buccal films which 
      were optimized through 2(2)factorial design. The permeation study from optimized 
      MLNS-film (B4) ensured an improved empagliflozin permeation along with a 
      controlled efflux for linagliptin, resolving possible risks due to the nonlinear 
      plasma profile. The in-vivo study of MLNS-film (B4) revealed that AUC((0-∞))of 
      linagliptin and empagliflozin was enhanced by two-fold and ten-fold, 
      respectively. Therefore, the nano-buccal formulation for the co-delivered 
      hypoglycemic drugs could contribute to improved clinical efficacy in the 
      treatment of diabetes.

TI  - Evaluating SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes: pharmacokinetic and 
      toxicological considerations.
PG  - 647-63
LID - 10.1517/17425255.2014.873788 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2), which 
      increase urinary glucose excretion independently of insulin, are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). AREAS 
      COVERED: An extensive literature search was performed to analyze the 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics, toxicological issues and safety concerns of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors in humans. This review focuses on three compounds 
      (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) with results obtained in healthy 
      volunteers (including drug-drug interactions), patients with T2DM (single dose 
      and multiple doses) and special populations (those with renal or hepatic 
      impairment). EXPERT OPINION: The three pharmacological agents share an excellent 
      oral bioavailability, long half-life allowing once-daily administration, low 
      accumulation index and renal clearance, the absence of active metabolites and a 
      limited propensity to drug-drug interactions. No clinically relevant changes in 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in T2DM patients or in patients with 
      mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment. Adverse events are a slightly 
      increased incidence of mycotic genital and rare benign urinary infections. SGLT2 
      inhibitors have the potential to reduce several cardiovascular risk factors, and 
      cardiovascular outcome trials are currently ongoing. The best positioning of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors in the armamentarium for treating T2DM is still a matter of 
      debate.

AB  - Three randomized control trials (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study, 
      Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
      Patients [EMPA-REG OUTCOME], and Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular

      the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, originally developed as

      outcomes, such as need for renal replacement therapy, doubling of serum 
      creatinine, and loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to those in 
      placebo groups. Besides, canagliflozin and empagliflozin also showed a lower risk 
      of progression to macroalbuminuria. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and DECLARE-TIMI 
      58 trial also indicated that these SGLT2 inhibitors might have beneficial effects 
      on the prevention of acute kidney injury. The United States Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) warned of the risk of acute kidney injury for canagliflozin 
      and dapagliflozin. We compared canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and dapagliflozin 
      with respect to chemical structure and pharmacological properties, to explain the 
      observed differences in preventing acute kidney injury, and put forward the 
      hypotheses of the potential mechanisms of different effects of SGLT2 inhibitors 
      on acute kidney injury. Given the raising clinical use of SGLT2 inhibitors, our 
      review should stimulate further basic science and clinical studies in order to 
      definitively understand the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in acute kidney injury. A 
      weakness of the clinical data obtained so far is the fact that the statements 
      concerning acute kidney injury are just based on safety data - mainly creatine 
      measurements. However, given the mode of action of SGLT2 blockers, initiation of 
      a therapy with a SGLT2 blocker will cause an increase of creatine because of its 
      effects on the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms/glomerular hemodynamics like 
      RAAS blocking agents do. To really understand the potential effects of SGLT2 
      inhibitors, we need preclinical and clinical SGLT2 inhibitor studies focusing on 
      all aspects of acute kidney injury - not just changes in GFR biomarkers.

      (SGLT2) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 33-59
LID - 10.1007/s40265-014-0337-y [doi]
AB  - Inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several 
      compounds are already available in many countries (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, 
      empagliflozin and ipragliflozin) and some others are in a late phase of 
      development. The available SGLT2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics, with a rapid oral absorption, a long elimination half-life 
      allowing once-daily administration, an extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via 
      glucuronidation to inactive metabolites, the absence of clinically relevant 
      drug-drug interactions and a low renal elimination as parent drug. SGLT2 
      co-transporters are responsible for reabsorption of most (90 %) of the glucose 
      filtered by the kidneys. The pharmacological inhibition of SGLT2 co-transporters 
      reduces hyperglycaemia by decreasing renal glucose threshold and thereby 
      increasing urinary glucose excretion. The amount of glucose excreted in the urine 
      depends on both the level of hyperglycaemia and the glomerular filtration rate. 
      Results of numerous placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials of 12-104 weeks 
      duration have shown significant reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), 
      resulting in a significant increase in the proportion of patients reaching HbA1c 
      targets, and a significant lowering of fasting plasma glucose when SGLT2 
      inhibitors were administered as monotherapy or in addition to other 
      glucose-lowering therapies including insulin in patients with T2DM. In 
      head-to-head trials of up to 2 years, SGLT2 inhibitors exerted similar 
      glucose-lowering activity to metformin, sulphonylureas or sitagliptin. The 
      durability of the glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be 
      better; however, this remains to be more extensively investigated. The risk of 
      hypoglycaemia was much lower with SGLT2 inhibitors than with sulphonylureas and 
      was similarly low as that reported with metformin, pioglitazone or sitagliptin. 
      Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss and could help to 
      reduce blood pressure. Both effects were very consistent across the trials and 
      they represent some advantages for SGLT2 inhibitors when compared with other oral 
      glucose-lowering agents. The pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors 
      declines with increasing severity of renal impairment, and prescribing 
      information for each SGLT2 inhibitor should be consulted regarding dosage 
      adjustments or restrictions in moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Caution is 
      also recommended in the elderly population because of a higher risk of renal 
      impairment, orthostatic hypotension and dehydration, even if the absence of 
      hypoglycaemia represents an obvious advantage in this population. The overall 
      effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of cardiovascular disease is unknown and 
      will be evaluated in several ongoing prospective placebo-controlled trials with 
      cardiovascular outcomes. The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function and 
      their potential to influence the course of diabetic nephropathy also deserve more 
      attention. SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated. The most frequently 
      reported adverse events are female genital mycotic infections, while urinary 
      tract infections are less commonly observed and generally benign. In conclusion, 
      with their unique mechanism of action that is independent of insulin secretion 
      and action, SGLT2 inhibitors are a useful addition to the therapeutic options 
      available for the management of T2DM at any stage in the natural history of the 
      disease. Although SGLT2 inhibitors have already been extensively investigated, 
      further studies should even better delineate the best place of these new 
      glucose-lowering agents in the already rich armamentarium for the management of 
      T2DM.

AB  - Introduction: Heart failure (HF) affects approximately 2% of the population 
      worldwide, remaining a major cause of hospitalization and mortality despite 
      innovative therapeutic approaches introduced in the past few decades. Type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) contributes significantly to end-organ damage and 
      HF-related complications and is associated with worse clinical status and 
      increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with HF with reduced 
      (HFrEF) or with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), compared to HF patients 
      without T2DM. Recently, a novel class of antidiabetic drugs has been introduced: 
      sodium glucose co-trasport-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Initially designed for patients 
      with T2DM to reduce kidney blood glucose resorption, SGLT2i rapidly gained 
      attention among HF specialists since they were able to show a beneficial 
      prognostic impact in patients affected by HF and T2DM, even independently from 
      the glycemic control as suggested by the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials. 
      Areas covered: The present review focuses on the mechanisms and the current 
      clinical evidence supporting the use of SGLT2i in HF patients with T2DM. 
      Moreover, the SGLT2i pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties will be 
      presented in order to better understand the rationale and the design of the 
      ongoing clinical trials investigating directly the effect of this new class of 
      drugs in patients with HF, even independently from T2DM. Expert opinion: SGLT2i 
      are emerging as an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of T2DM and 
      current evidence has unexpectedly demonstrated a robust cardiovascular protection 
      in HF patients with T2DM. Therefore, ongoing clinical trials are investigating 
      directly the effect of this new class of drugs in patients with HF, even 
      independently from T2DM. However, it is methodologically disappointing that the 
      mechanisms underlying the encouraging results in cardiovascular protection of 
      this drug class are still not fully understood. A better understanding of the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of SGLT2i is necessary in order to 
      better determine the effect of this new class of drugs in patients with HF.

LID - e0147391
AB  - The novel sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin has 
      recently been reported to improve glycemic control in streptozotocin-induced type 
      1 diabetic rats in an insulin-independent manner, via an increase in urinary 
      glucose output. We investigated the potential of empagliflozin to recover insulin 
      pathways in type 1 diabetes by improving pancreatic β-cell mass. Blood glucose 
      homeostasis was assessed by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Serum 
      insulin levels and insulin mRNA expression were determined using commercial 
      insulin ELISA kits and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, 
      respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate β-cell areas, β-cell 
      proliferation, apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells, and reactive oxygen species 
      production in the pancreatic β-cells. Results showed that glucose tolerance was 
      significantly improved in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice treated 
      with empagliflozin. Empagliflozin-treated mice also showed an increase in insulin 
      mRNA expression. Higher serum insulin levels were detected in mice treated with 
      empagliflozin compared with the vehicle group. Immunohistochemistry indicated 
      that β-cell area/total pancreatic area and the expression of cell proliferation 
      marker Ki-67 (co-stained with insulin) were significantly enhanced by 
      empagliflozin treatment. These effects were due, probably, to a reduction in 
      apoptosis and reactive oxygen species in the pancreatic β-cells. Taken together, 
      the results of this study indicate that empagliflozin may have a beneficial 
      effect on preserving β-cell regeneration, thus improving blood glucose 
      homeostasis in type 1 diabetes mellitus, probably via the protection of 
      pancreatic β-cell from glucotoxicity-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inhibition of the renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is a 
      novel concept in the therapy of diabetes mellitus. In this study, we first 
      assessed whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 
      SGLT2-encoding gene SLC5A2 affect diabetes-related metabolic traits in subjects 
      at risk for type 2 diabetes and, second, whether these have pharmacogenetic 
      relevance by interfering with the response to empagliflozin treatment in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples from a metabolically 
      well-phenotyped cross-sectional study population (total N=2600) at increased risk 
      for type 2 diabetes and pooled pharmacogenetic samples from patients from four 
      phase III trials of empagliflozin (in total: 603 receiving empagliflozin, 305 
      receiving placebo) were genotyped for five common SNPs (minor allele frequencies 
      ≥5%) present in the SLC5A2 gene locus. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, 
      none of the SLC5A2 SNPs significantly influenced metabolic traits such as body 
      fat, insulin sensitivity/resistance, insulin release, HbA1c, plasma glucose, or 
      systolic blood pressure when multiple testing was taken into account (all 
      P≥0.0083). Further, no relevant effect on response to treatment with 
      empagliflozin on HbA1c, fasting glucose, weight, or systolic blood pressure was 
      observed for the SNPs tested in the pharmacogenetic study. CONCLUSION: Common 
      genetic variants in the SLC5A2 gene neither affects diabetes-related metabolic 
      traits nor have a clinically relevant impact on response to treatment with the 
      SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide and its 
      prevalence is estimated to rise in the future. Billions of dollars are spent each 
      year around the world in health expenditure related to diabetes. There are 
      several anti-diabetic drugs in the market for the treatment of non-insulin 
      dependent diabetes mellitus. In this article, we will be talking about a 
      relatively new class of anti-diabetic drugs called sodium glucose co-transporter 
      2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This class of drugs has a unique mechanism of action 
      focusing on inhibition of glucose reabsorption that separates it from other 
      classes. This article covers the mechanism of glucose reabsorption in the 
      kidneys, the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, several SGLT2 inhibitors 
      currently available in the market as well as those in various phases of 
      development, their individual pharmacokinetics as well as the discussion about 
      the future role of SGLT2 inhibitors, not only for the treatment of diabetes, but 
      also for various other diseases like obesity, hepatic steatosis, and 
      cardiovascular disorders.

TI  - A new HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of SGLT2 inhibitors 
      and metformin in plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - e4663
LID - 10.1002/bmc.4663 [doi]
AB  - Monitoring the plasma concentrations of metformin and sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) is 
      essential for pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies and therapeutic 
      monitoring. The present work therefore aimed to develop and validate a 
      high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
      (HPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of these drugs in human 
      plasma. The analyses were performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system coupled to 
      an Applied Biosystems API 3200 triple quadrupole MS/MS with electrospray 
      ionization in positive ion mode. After one-step protein precipitation of plasma 
      with acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, chromatographic separation was 
      achieved on an Xbridge C(18) column, with a mobile phase consisting of a gradient 
      of water and acetonitrile, both containing 1 mm ammonium formate and 0.1% formic 
      acid. Quantification was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode using m/z 
      130.1 → 71.1 for metformin, m/z 462.0 → 191.2 for canagliflozin, m/z 
      426.1 → 167.1 for dapagliflozin and m/z 468.0 → 354.9 for empagliflozin. The 
      proposed method was validated and demonstrated to be adequate for the 
      quantification of metformin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin for 
      clinical monitoring, pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence studies.

TI  - SGLT-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk: proposed pathways and review of 
      ongoing outcome trials.
PG  - 90-100
LID - 10.1177/1479164114559852 [doi]
AB  - Given the multi-faceted pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM), it is likely that interventions to mitigate this risk must 
      address cardiovascular (CV) risk factors beyond glucose itself. Sodium glucose 
      cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are newer antihyperglycaemic agents with 
      apparent multiple effects. Inherent in their mode of action to decrease glucose 
      reabsorption by the kidneys by increasing urinary glucose excretion, these agents 
      improve glycaemic control independent of insulin secretion with a low risk of 
      hypoglycaemia. In this review, we outline those CV risk factors that this class 
      appears to influence and provide the design features and trial characteristics of 
      six ongoing outcome trials involving more than 41,000 individuals with T2DM. 
      Those risk factors beyond glucose that can potentially be modulated positively 
      with SGLT-2 inhibitors include blood pressure, weight, visceral adiposity, 
      hyperinsulinaemia, arterial stiffness, albuminuria, circulating uric acid levels 
      and oxidative stress. On the other hand, small increases in low-density 
      lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels have also been observed for the class, which 
      theoretically might offset some of these benefits. The potential translational 
      impact of these effects is being tested with outcome trials, also reviewed in 
      this article, powered to assess both macrovascular as well as certain 
      microvascular outcomes in T2DM. These are expected to begin to report in late 
      2015.

AB  - Accumulating data from recent studies has altered the gold standard of care for 
      diabetes treatment. In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) or those at high risk for CVD, subsequently to 
      lifestyle changes and metformin therapy, the administration of an SGLT-2 
      inhibitor with established benefits for cardiovascular outcome (CVOT) should be 
      considered. Areas covered: Tofogliflozin is the most selective SGLT-2 inhibitor 
      and has been approved for the treatment of T2D in Japan. This review summarizes 
      the available data on Tofogliflozin as compared to other SGLT-2 inhibitors, and 
      primarily the three SGLT-2 inhibitors with published CVOT: Empagliflozin, 
      Canagliflozin and Dapagliflozin. Expert opinion: Tofogliflozin's higher 
      selectivity profile increases the positive effects on cardiovascular (CV) 
      outcomes and death and reduces side effects. However, the clinical data on 
      Tofogliflozin from both clinical and real-world studies remain sparse and much 
      less abundant than the other main 3 SGLT-2 inhibitors, thus calling for caution 
      and underscoring the need for further research.

TI  - A Systematic Critical Review of Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Torasemide.
PG  - 309-320
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000001141 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Torasemide is a potassium-sparing loop diuretic used to treat fluid 
      retention associated with congestive heart failure and kidney and hepatic 
      diseases. This systematic review was conducted to combine all accessible data on 
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of torasemide in healthy and diseased populations, 
      which may help clinicians avert adverse drug reactions and determine the correct 
      dosage regimen. METHODS: Four databases were systematically searched to screen 
      for studies associated with the PK of torasemide, and 21 studies met the 
      eligibility criteria. The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database 
      (CRD42023390178). RESULTS: A decrease in maximum plasma concentration (C max ) 
      was observed for torasemide after administration of the prolonged-release 
      formulation in comparison to that after administration of the immediate-release 
      formulation, that is, 1.12 ± 0.17 versus 1.6 ± 0.2 mcg/mL. After administering an 
      oral dose of torasemide, a 2-fold increase in the area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) was reported in patients with congestive heart 
      failure compared with the healthy population. Moreover, the patients with renal 
      failure (clearance < 30 mL/min) showed an increase in value of AUC 0-∞ that is, 
      42.9 versus 8.091 mcg.h -1 .mL -1 compared with healthy subjects. In addition, 
      some studies have reported interactions with different drugs, in which irbesartan 
      showed a slight increase in the AUC 0-∞ of torasemide, whereas losartan and 
      empagliflozin did not. CONCLUSIONS: The current review summarizes all available 
      PK parameters of torasemide that may be beneficial for avoiding drug-drug 
      interactions in subjects with renal and hepatic dysfunction and for predicting 
      doses in patients with different diseases.

TI  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition and the potential for renal protection 
      in diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 96-103
LID - 10.1097/MNH.0000000000000084 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Renal hyperfiltration has been used as a surrogate marker for 
      increased intraglomerular pressure in patients with diabetes mellitus. Previous 
      human investigation examining the pathogenesis of hyperfiltration has focused on 
      the role of neurohormones such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
      (RAAS). Unfortunately, RAAS blockade does not completely attenuate 
      hyperfiltration or diabetic kidney injury. More recent work has therefore 
      investigated the contribution of renal tubular factors, including the 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter, to the hyperfiltration state, which is the topic of 
      this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Novel sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitors reduce proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, thereby increasing distal 
      sodium delivery to the macula densa, causing tubuloglomerular feedback, afferent 
      vasoconstriction and decreased hyperfiltration in animals. In humans, SGLT2 
      inhibition was recently shown to reduce hyperfiltration in normotensive, 
      normoalbuminuric patients with type 1 diabetes. In clinical trials of type 2 
      diabetes, SGLT2 is associated with significant renal effects, including modest, 
      acute declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate followed by the 
      maintenance of stable renal function, and reduced albuminuria. SUMMARY: Existing 
      data are supportive of a potential renal-protective role for SGLT2 inhibition in 
      patients with diabetes. Dedicated renal outcome trials are ongoing and have the 
      potential to change the clinical practice.

      pancreatitis: An experimental study.

AB  - Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe inflammatory disorder hampered by a lack of 
      effective drugs in its clinical practice. Empagliflozin (EMP) exhibits potential 
      effects against AP but is limited by poor water-solubility and low 
      bioavailability. Herein, a novel self-nanomicellizing formulation of EMP with 
      phytochemical rebaudioside A (RA) as the nanocarrier (RA-EMP) was fabricated to 
      address these issues. RA-EMP powder could be simply prepared and exhibited 
      excellent storage stability, dramatically improved EMP's apparent solubility, and 
      instantly self-assembled into micelles with high EMP encapsulation efficiency in 
      water. In vivo experimental studies showed that RA-EMP exhibited significantly 
      enhanced oral bioavailability of EMP and dramatically improved therapeutic 
      efficacy against AP. The mechanisms through suppressing the effects of oxidative 
      stress and proinflammatory cytokines were involved in this therapeutic effect. 
      The results demonstrated that RA-EMP could serve as a promising way to enhance 
      the oral bioavailability and strengthen the potential therapeutic efficacy of EMP 
      against AP.

TI  - Organic anion transporter OAT3 enhances the glucosuric effect of the SGLT2 
      inhibitor empagliflozin.
PG  - F386-F394
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00503.2017 [doi]
AB  - The sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin (plasma protein 
      binding ~88%) may reach its target in the brush border of the early proximal 
      tubule by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Here we determined whether 
      empagliflozin is secreted by renal tubules in mice and whether genetic knockout 
      of the basolateral organic anion transporter 3 ( Oat3-/-) affects its tubular 
      secretion or glucosuric effect. Renal clearance studies in wild-type (WT) mice 
      showed that tubular secretion accounted for 50-70% of empagliflozin urinary 
      excretion. Immunostaining indicated that SGLT2 and OAT3 localization partially 
      overlapped in proximal tubule S1 and S2 segments. Glucosuria in metabolic cage 
      studies was reduced in Oat3-/- vs. WT mice for acute empagliflozin doses of 1, 3, 
      and 10 mg/kg, whereas 30 mg/kg induced similar maximal glucosuria in both 
      genotypes. Chronic application of empagliflozin (~25 mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1)) in 
      Oat3-/- mice was associated with lower urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratios 
      despite maintaining slightly higher blood glucose levels than WT. On a whole 
      kidney level, renal secretion of empagliflozin was largely unchanged in Oat3-/- 
      mice. However, the absence of OAT3 attenuated the influence of empagliflozin on 
      fractional glucose excretion; higher levels of plasma or filtered empagliflozin 
      were needed to induce similar increases in fractional renal glucose excretion. We 
      conclude that empagliflozin is excreted into the urine to similar extent by 
      glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. The latter can occur largely 
      independent of OAT3. However, OAT3 increases the glucosuric effect of 
      empagliflozin, which may relate to the partial overlap of its localization with 
      SGLT2 and thus OAT3-mediated tubular secretion of empagliflozin in the early 
      proximal tubule.

TI  - Empagliflozin as adjunct to insulin in Japanese participants with type 1 
      diabetes: Results of a 4-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 
      2 trial.
PG  - 2190-2199
LID - 10.1111/dom.13351 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02702011) with 4 sites in Japan investigated the 
      pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profile of empagliflozin 
      in Japanese participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) as adjunctive 
      therapy to insulin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants using multiple daily 
      injections of insulin for ≥12 months, with HbA1c of 7.5%-10.0%, entered a 2-week, 
      open-label, placebo run-in period, followed by a 4-week, double-blind period 
      during which participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive empagliflozin 2.5 mg 
      (n = 13), empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 12), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 12) or placebo 
      (n = 11). The primary objective was to assess the effect of empagliflozin vs 
      placebo on urinary glucose excretion (UGE) after 7 days of treatment. RESULTS: 
      PD: Empagliflozin resulted in a dose-dependent significant increase in 24-hour 
      UGE compared with placebo (UGE placebo-corrected mean [95% confidence interval] 
      change from baseline: 2.5 mg, 65.10 [43.29, 86.90] g/24 h; 10 mg, 81.19 [58.80, 
      103.58] g/24 h; 25 mg, 98.11 [75.91, 120.31] g/24 h). After 4 weeks of treatment, 
      UGE increase was associated with improved glycaemic control, reduced body weight 
      and decreased insulin needs. Empagliflozin treatment also resulted in 
      dose-dependent increases in serum ketone bodies and free fatty acids. PK: Plasma 
      empagliflozin levels increased in a dose-dependent manner and peaked at 1.5 
      hours. In this short study, empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increase in 
      rate of hypoglycaemia and no diabetic ketoacidosis events reported. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Based on this short-duration phase 2 study, the PK/PD profile of empagliflozin in 
      Japanese participants with T1DM is comparable to that of non-Japanese 
      participants.

TI  - The Role of Glucagon in the Acute Therapeutic Effects of SGLT2 Inhibition.
PG  - 2619-2629
LID - 10.2337/db20-0369 [doi]
AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) effectively lower plasma 
      glucose (PG) concentration in patients with type 2 diabetes, but studies have 
      suggested that circulating glucagon concentrations and endogenous glucose 
      production (EGP) are increased by SGLT2i, possibly compromising their 
      glucose-lowering ability. To tease out whether and how glucagon may influence the 
      glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibition, we subjected 12 patients with type 2 
      diabetes to a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover, 
      double-dummy study comprising, on 4 separate days, a liquid mixed-meal test 
      preceded by single-dose administration of either 1) placebo, 2) the SGLT2i 
      empagliflozin (25 mg), 3) the glucagon receptor antagonist LY2409021 (300 mg), or 
      4) the combination empagliflozin + LY2409021. Empagliflozin and LY2409021 
      individually lowered fasting PG compared with placebo, and the combination 
      further decreased fasting PG. Previous findings of increased glucagon 
      concentrations and EGP during acute administration of SGLT2i were not replicated 
      in this study. Empagliflozin reduced postprandial PG through increased urinary 
      glucose excretion. LY2409021 reduced EGP significantly but gave rise to a 
      paradoxical increase in postprandial PG excursion, which was annulled by 
      empagliflozin during their combination (empagliflozin + LY2409021). In 
      conclusion, our findings do not support that an SGLT2i-induced glucagonotropic 
      effect is of importance for the glucose-lowering property of SGLT2 inhibition.

TI  - Mechanistic evaluation of the inhibitory effect of four SGLT-2 inhibitors on SGLT

      approaches.

AB  - Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT 2, gliflozins) inhibitors are potent 
      orally active drugs approved for managing type 2 diabetes. SGLT 2 inhibitors 
      exert a glucose-lowering effect by suppressing sodium-glucose co-transporters 1 
      and 2 in the intestinal and kidney proximal tubules. In this study, we developed 
      a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and simulated the 
      concentrations of ertugliflozin, empagliflozin, henagliflozin, and sotagliflozin 
      in target tissues. We used the perfusion-limited model to illustrate the 
      disposition of SGLT 2 inhibitors in vivo. The modeling parameters were obtained 
      from the references. Simulated steady-state plasma concentration-time curves of 
      the ertugliflozin, empagliflozin, henagliflozin, and sotagliflozin are similar to 
      the clinically observed curves. The 90% prediction interval of simulated 
      excretion of drugs in urine captured the observed data well. Furthermore, all 
      corresponding model-predicted pharmacokinetic parameters fell within a 2-fold 
      prediction error. At the approved doses, we estimated the effective 
      concentrations in intestinal and kidney proximal tubules and calculated the 
      inhibition ratio of SGLT transporters to differentiate the relative inhibition 
      capacities of SGLT1 and 2 in each gliflozin. According to simulation results, 
      four SGLT 2 inhibitors can nearly completely inhibit SGLT 2 transporter at the 
      approved dosages. Sotagliflozin exhibited the highest inhibition activity on 
      SGLT1, followed by ertugliflozin, empagliflozin, and henagliflozin, which showed 
      a lower SGLT 1 inhibitory effect. The PBPK model successfully simulates the 
      specific target tissue concentration that cannot be measured directly and 
      quantifies the relative contribution toward SGLT 1 and 2 for each gliflozin.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetic- Pharmacodynamic Analysis to Characterize the Effect 
      of Empagliflozin on Renal Glucose Threshold in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes

PG  - 640-649
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1051 [doi]
AB  - Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion 
      (UGE) by lowering the renal threshold for glucose (RT(G) ). We aimed to quantify 
      the effect of the sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitor empagliflozin on renal 
      glucose reabsorption in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using a 
      mechanistic population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model and to 
      compare results with analyses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      The PK-PD model was developed using data from a randomized phase 2 study in which 
      patients with T1DM received oral once-daily empagliflozin 2.5 mg, empagliflozin 
      10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo as an adjunct to insulin. The model 
      assumed that UGE was dependent on plasma glucose and renal function and that 
      empagliflozin lowered RT(G) . The final model was evaluated using visual 
      predictive checks and found to be consistent with observed data. Calculated RT(G) 
      with placebo was 181 mg/dL, and with empagliflozin (steady state) 1 mg and 2.5 mg 
      was 53.4 mg/dL and 12.5 mg/dL, respectively. Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg 
      yielded negative RT(G) values, implying RT(G) was reduced to a negligible value. 
      Although estimated PK-PD parameters were generally comparable between patients 
      with T1DM and patients with T2DM, slight differences were evident, leading to 
      lower RT(G) and higher UGE in patients with T1DM compared with patients with 
      T2DM. In conclusion, the model provided a reasonable description of UGE in 
      response to administration of empagliflozin and placebo in patients with T1DM.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions with sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitors, new oral glucose-lowering agents for the management of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) reduce hyperglycaemia 
      by decreasing renal glucose threshold and thereby increasing urinary glucose 
      excretion. They are proposed as a novel approach for the management of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. They have proven their efficacy in reducing glycated 
      haemoglobin, without inducing hypoglycaemia, as monotherapy or in combination 
      with various other glucose-lowering agents, with the add-on value of promoting 
      some weight loss and lowering arterial blood pressure. As they may be used 
      concomitantly with many other drugs, we review the potential drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) regarding the three leaders in the class (dapagliglozin, 
      canagliflozin and empagliflozin). Most of the available studies were performed in 
      healthy volunteers and have assessed the pharmacokinetic interferences with a 
      single administration of the SGLT2 inhibitor. The exposure [assessed by peak 
      plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)] 
      to each SGLT2 inhibitor tested was not significantly influenced by the 
      concomitant administration of other glucose-lowering agents or cardiovascular 
      agents commonly used in patients with type 2 diabetes. Reciprocally, these 
      medications did not influence the pharmacokinetic parameters of dapagliflozin, 
      canagliflozin or empagliflozin. Some modest changes were not considered as 
      clinically relevant. However, drugs that could specifically interfere with the 
      metabolic pathways of SGLT2 inhibitors [rifampicin, inhibitors or inducers of 
      uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)] may result in significant 
      changes in the exposure of SGLT2 inhibitors, as shown for dapagliflozin and 
      canagliflozin. Potential DDIs in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving chronic 
      treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor deserve further attention, especially in 
      individuals treated with several medications or in more fragile patients with 
      hepatic and/or renal impairment.

TI  - Plasma Pharmacokinetic Determination of Canagliflozin and Its Metabolites in a 
      Type 2 Diabetic Rat Model by UPLC-MS/MS.
LID - 10.3390/molecules23051229 [doi]
LID - 1229
AB  - Canagliflozin is a novel, orally selective inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. In this study, a sensitive and efficient UPLC-MS/MS method for the 
      quantification of canagliflozin and its metabolites in rat plasma was established 
      and applied to pharmacokinetics in a type 2 diabetic rat model. We firstly 
      investigated the pharmacokinetic changes of canagliflozin and its metabolites in 
      type 2 diabetic rats in order to use canagliflozin more safely, reasonably and 
      effectively. We identified three types of O-glucuronide metabolites (M5, M7 and 
      M17), two kinds of oxidation metabolites (M8 and M9) and one oxidation and 
      glucuronide metabolite (M16) using API 5600 triple-TOF-MS/MS. Following 
      liquid⁻liquid extraction by tert-butyl methyl ether, chromatographic separation 
      of canagliflozin and its metabolites were performed on a Waters XBridge BEH C18 
      column (100 × 2.1 mm, 2.5 μm) using 0.1% acetonitrile⁻formic acid (75:15, v/v) as 
      the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Selected ion monitoring 
      transitions of m/z 462.00→191.10, 451.20→153.10, 638.10→191.10 and 478.00→267.00 
      were chosen to quantify canagliflozin, empagliflozin (IS), O-glucuronide 
      metabolites (M5, M7 and M17), and oxidation metabolites (M9) using an API 
      5500-triple-MS/MS in the positive electrospray ionization mode. The validation of 
      the method was found to be of sufficient specificity, accuracy and precision. The 
      pathological condition of diabetes could result in altered pharmacokinetic 
      behaviors of canagliflozin and its metabolites. The pharmacokinetic parameters 
      (AUC(0⁻t), AUC(0⁻∞), CL(z)/F, and V(z)/F) of canagliflozin were significantly 
      different between the CTRL and DM group rats (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), which may 
      subsequently cause different therapeutic effects.

TI  - The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin does not prolong QT 
      interval in a thorough QT (TQT) study.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/1475-2840-12-70 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is a potent, selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 
      (SGLT2) inhibitor in development as an oral antidiabetic treatment. This QT 
      interval study assessed potential effects of empagliflozin on ventricular 
      repolarisation and other electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. METHODS: A 
      randomised, placebo-controlled, single-dose, double-blind, five-period crossover 
      study incorporating a novel double-placebo period design to reduce sample size, 
      while maintaining full statistical power. TREATMENTS: single empagliflozin doses 
      of 25 mg (therapeutic) and 200 mg (supratherapeutic), matching placebo and 
      open-label moxifloxacin 400 mg (positive control). Triplicate 12-lead ECGs of 10 
      second duration were recorded at baseline and during the first 24 hours after 
      dosing. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline (MCfB) in the 
      population heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTcN) between 1-4 hours after 
      dosing. RESULTS: Thirty volunteers (16 male, 14 female, mean [range] age: 34.5 
      [18-52] years) were randomised. The placebo-corrected MCfB in QTcN 1-4 hours 
      after dosing was 0.6 (90% CI: -0.7, 1.9) ms and -0.2 (-1.4, 0.9) ms for 
      empagliflozin 25 mg and 200 mg, respectively, below the ICH E14 defined threshold 
      of regulatory concern 10 ms. Assay sensitivity was confirmed by a 
      placebo-corrected MCfB in QTcN 2-4 hours post-dose of 12.4 (10.7, 14.1) ms with 
      moxifloxacin 400 mg. Empagliflozin tolerability was good for all volunteers; 
      23.3% experienced adverse events (AEs) with empagliflozin and 27.6% with placebo. 
      The most frequent AE was nasopharyngitis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Single 
      doses of empagliflozin 25 mg and 200 mg were not associated with QTcN 
      prolongation and were well tolerated in healthy volunteers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01195675.

TI  - Mixed-effects modelling to quantify the effect of empagliflozin on renal glucose 
      reabsorption in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 241-8
LID - 10.1111/dom.12597 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To quantify the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, 
      empagliflozin, on renal glucose reabsorption in patients with type 2 diabetes, 
      and to evaluate covariate effects, using a mechanistic population 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model. METHODS: Four phase I/II trials 
      were used for model development. Empagliflozin's PK characteristics were 
      characterized by a two-compartmental model with sequential zero- and first-order 
      absorption. Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) was described as dependent on renal 
      glucose filtration and reabsorption; splay of the glucose reabsorption/excretion 
      curves was considered. The modelling assumed that empagliflozin lowers the 
      maximum renal glucose reabsorption capacity and, thereby, the renal threshold for 
      glucose (RTg). Covariate effects were investigated using a full covariate 
      modelling approach, emphasizing parameter estimation. RESULTS: The PK-PD model 
      provided a reasonable description of the PK characteristics of empagliflozin and 
      its effects on UGE across a range of renal function levels. Its parameters are 
      consistent with reported values for renal physiology. Using this model, the 
      effect of empagliflozin on renal glucose reabsorption was quantified. 
      Steady-state empagliflozin doses (1, 5, 10 and 25 mg) reduced RTg from 
      12.5 mmol/L [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.0, 13.1] to 5.66 (95% CI 4.62, 
      6.72), 3.01 (95% CI 2.33, 3.69), 2.53 (95% CI 1.83, 3.14) and 2.21 (95% CI 1.47, 
      2.84) mg/dl, respectively. Covariate analysis showed the effect of empagliflozin 
      on UGE was not influenced, to a clinically relevant extent, by sex, age or race. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A method for characterizing renal glucose reabsorption was developed 
      that does not require complex glucose clamp experiments. These analyses indicate 
      that empagliflozin provided concentration-dependent RTg reductions, with 10 and 
      25 mg providing near-maximum RTg-lowering.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower glycemia by 
      enhancing urinary glucose excretion. The physiologic response to 
      pharmacologically induced acute or chronic glycosuria has not been investigated 
      in human diabetes. METHODS: We evaluated 66 patients with type 2 diabetes (62 ± 7 
      years, BMI = 31.6 ± 4.6 kg/m(2), HbA1c = 55 ± 8 mmol/mol, mean ± SD) at baseline, 
      after a single dose, and following 4-week treatment with empagliflozin (25 mg). 
      At each time point, patients received a mixed meal coupled with dual-tracer 
      glucose administration and indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Both single-dose and 
      chronic empagliflozin treatment caused glycosuria during fasting (median, 7.8 
      [interquartile range {IQR}, 4.4] g/3 hours and 9.2 [IQR, 5.2] g/3 hours) and 
      after meal ingestion (median, 29.0 [IQR, 12.5] g/5 hours and 28.2 [IQR, 15.4] g/5 
      hours). After 3 hours of fasting, endogenous glucose production (EGP) was 
      increased 25%, while glycemia was 0.9 ± 0.7 mmol/l lower (P < 0.0001 vs. 
      baseline). After meal ingestion, glucose and insulin AUC decreased, whereas the 
      glucagon response increased (all P < 0.001). While oral glucose appearance was 
      unchanged, EGP was increased (median, 40 [IQR, 14] g and 37 [IQR, 11] g vs. 34 
      [IQR, 11] g, both P < 0.01). Tissue glucose disposal was reduced (median, 75 
      [IQR, 16] g and 70 [IQR, 21] g vs. 93 [IQR, 18] g, P < 0.0001), due to a decrease 
      in both glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose disposal, with a concomitant 
      rise in lipid oxidation after chronic administration (all P < 0.01). β Cell 
      glucose sensitivity increased (median, 55 [IQR, 35] pmol • min(-1) • m(-2) • 
      mM(-1) and 55 [IQR, 39] pmol • min(-1) • m(-2) • mM(-1) vs. 44 [IQR, 32] pmol • 
      min(-1) • m(-2) • mM(-1), P < 0.0001), and insulin sensitivity was improved. 
      Resting energy expenditure rates and those after meal ingestion were unchanged. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin-induced glycosuria 
      improved β cell function and insulin sensitivity, despite the fall in insulin 
      secretion and tissue glucose disposal and the rise in EGP after one dose, thereby 
      lowering fasting and postprandial glycemia. Chronic dosing shifted substrate 
      utilization from carbohydrate to lipid. Trial registration. ClinicalTrials.Gov 
      NCT01248364 (EudraCT no. 2010-018708-99). Funding. This study was funded by

TI  - [Dapagliflozin (forxiga®) : SGLT 2 cotransporter inhibitor as glucose-lowering 
      agent in type 2 diabetes].
PG  - 463-469
AB  - Dapagliflozin, a specific inhibitor of sodium-glu¬cose cotransporters type 2 
      (SGLT2, inhibits glucose reabsorp¬tion in renal tubules and thus promotes 
      glucosuria. This effect results in a reduction in fasting and postprandial 
      glycaemia and a decrease of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), with a minor risk of 
      hypoglycaemia, a weight reduction and a reduction in arterial blood pressure. The 
      efficacy of empagliflozin on HbA1c reduction increases according to the level of 
      hyper¬glycaemia but decreases in patients with renal insufficiency. Mycotic 
      genital infections occur more frequently, especially in women, while a negligible 
      increase in mild urinary tract infections may be observed. Dapagliflozin 
      (Forxiga®), 10 mg once daily, is indicated for the treatment of T2DM and 
      reim¬bursed in Belgium with conditions as add-on to a background glucose-lowering 
      therapy (either metformin or sulfonylurea/ repaglinide or metformin plus 
      sulfonylurea/repaglinide or basal insulin plus at least one of these oral 
      glucose-lowering agents). Preliminary results suggest some cardiovascular and 
      renal protection. These results should be confirmed in an ongoing large 
      prospective controlled trial (DECLARE) in type 2 diabetic patients at high 
      cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Relative bioavailability of an empagliflozin 25-mg/linagliptin 5-mg fixed-dose 
      combination tablet .
PG  - 355-367
LID - 10.5414/CP202929 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This relative bioavailability study compared a fixed-dose combination 
      (FDC) tablet of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg with the corresponding 
      individual components. In addition, the effect of food on the bioavailability of 
      the FDC was studied, and the standard-dissolving formulation FDC was compared 
      with a slow-dissolving side batch. METHODS: An open-label, randomized, crossover 
      study design was used (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01189201). Healthy 
      volunteers (n = 42) each received three single-dose treatments: FDC standard 
      dissolution, individual tablets, and either FDC standard dissolution with food or 
      FDC slow dissolution. Primary endpoints for relative bioavailability comparisons 
      were area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) over time 0 to the last 
      time point with the plasma concentration above the quantification limit 
      (AUC(0-tz)) for empagliflozin, AUC from 0 to 72 hours (AUC(0-72)) for 
      linagliptin, and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) for both drugs. RESULTS: 
      In all three comparisons, the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of AUCs 
      were within the standard acceptance range (80 - 125%) for bioequivalence. 
      Empagliflozin and linagliptin both showed reductions in C(max) after food 
      compared with the fasted state, although overall exposure remained similar. The 
      empagliflozin/linagliptin combinations were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study shows that the FDC of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg can be regarded 
      as bioequivalent to the individual tablets. Administering the tablet after food 
      or a tablet with a slow-dissolution profile did not have a clinically-relevant 
      impact on the bioavailability of empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC tablets. .

TI  - Assessment of Proximal Tubular Function by Tubular Maximum Phosphate Reabsorption 
      Capacity in Heart Failure.
PG  - 228-239
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03720321 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a 
      crucial parameter in heart failure. Much less is known about the importance of 
      tubular function. We addressed the effect of tubular maximum phosphate 
      reabsorption capacity (TmP/GFR), a parameter of proximal tubular function, in 
      patients with heart failure. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We 
      established TmP/GFR (Bijvoet formula) in 2085 patients with heart failure and 
      studied its association with deterioration of kidney function (>25% eGFR decrease 
      from baseline) and plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) 
      doubling (baseline to 9 months) using logistic regression analysis and clinical 
      outcomes using Cox proportional hazards regression. Additionally, we evaluated 
      the effect of sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibition by 
      empagliflozin on tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption capacity in 78 patients 
      with acute heart failure using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Low TmP/GFR 
      (<0.80 mmol/L) was observed in 1392 (67%) and 21 (27%) patients. Patients with 
      lower TmP/GFR had more advanced heart failure, lower eGFR, and higher levels of 
      tubular damage markers. The main determinant of lower TmP/GFR was higher 
      fractional excretion of urea (P<0.001). Lower TmP/GFR was independently 
      associated with higher risk of plasma NGAL doubling (odds ratio, 2.20; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.05 to 4.66; P=0.04) but not with deterioration of kidney 
      function. Lower TmP/GFR was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality 
      (hazard ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.37 to 5.73; P=0.005), heart 
      failure hospitalization (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 
      4.88; P=0.03), and their combination (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence 
      interval, 1.07 to 3.36; P=0.03) after multivariable adjustment. Empagliflozin 
      significantly increased TmP/GFR compared with placebo after 1 day (P=0.004) but 
      not after adjustment for eGFR change. CONCLUSIONS: TmP/GFR, a measure of proximal 
      tubular function, is frequently reduced in heart failure, especially in patients 
      with more advanced heart failure. Lower TmP/GFR is furthermore associated with 
      future risk of plasma NGAL doubling and worse clinical outcomes, independent of 
      glomerular function.

TI  - The SGLT2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: 
      a Bench to Bedside Review.
PG  - 43-63
LID - 10.1007/s13300-014-0063-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to pose 
      challenges for clinicians and patients. The dramatic rise in T2DM prevalence, 
      which has paralleled the rise in obesity, has strained the healthcare system and 
      prompted the search for therapies that not only effectively treat hyperglycemia, 
      but are also weight neutral or promote weight loss. In most clinical situations 
      after diagnosis, patients are advised to adopt lifestyle changes and metformin is 
      initiated to help control blood glucose levels. However, metformin may not be 
      tolerated, or may not be sufficient for those with higher glucose levels at 
      diagnosis. Even among those who have initial success with metformin, the majority 
      eventually require one or more additional agents to achieve their treatment 
      goals. Because T2DM is a progressive disease, the requirement for combination 
      treatment escalates over time, driving the need for therapies with complementary 
      mechanisms of action. METHODS AND RESULTS: Online public resources were searched 
      using "empagliflozin", identifying 32 articles in PubMed, and 12 abstracts 
      presented at the 2013 American Diabetes Association meeting. Peer-reviewed 
      articles and abstracts describing preclinical studies and clinical trials were 
      retrieved, and relevant publications included in this review. Trials registered 
      on clinicaltrials.gov were searched for ongoing empagliflozin studies. 
      CONCLUSION: The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are of great 
      interest since they provide a novel, insulin-independent mechanism of action. The 
      SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin has demonstrated promising pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic properties. In clinical trials, empagliflozin has demonstrated a 
      good efficacy and safety profile in a broad range of patients with T2DM, and 
      appears to be an attractive adjunct therapeutic option for the treatment of T2DM. 
      Ongoing trials, including patients with T2DM and comorbidities such as 
      hypertension, are expected to provide important additional data, which will 
      further define the role of empagliflozin in a growing movement toward 
      individualized approaches to diabetes care.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) are new glucose-lowering agents that exert their 
      therapeutic activity independently of insulin by facilitating glucose excretion 
      through the kidneys. However, this simple renal mechanism that results in 
      sustained glucose urinary loss leads to more complex indirect metabolic effects. 
      First, by reduction of chronic hyperglycaemia and attenuation of glucose 
      toxicity, SGLT-2 inhibitors can improve both insulin secretion by beta cells and 
      peripheraltissue insulin sensitivity. In the case of canagliflozin, because of 
      low-potency SGLT1 inhibition, a non-renal (intestinal) effect may also be 
      considered, which may contribute to better control of postprandial 
      hyperglycaemia, although this contribution remains to be better analyzed in 
      humans. Second, chronic glucose loss most probably leads to compensatory 
      mechanisms. One of them, although not well evidenced in humans, might involve an 
      increase in energy intake, an effect that may limit weight loss in the long run. 
      Another could be an increase in endogenous glucose production, most probably 
      driven by increased glucagon secretion, which may somewhat attenuate the 
      glucoselowering effect. Nevertheless, despite these compensatory mechanisms and 
      most probably because of the positive effects of the reduction in glucotoxicity, 
      SGLT-2 inhibitors exert clinically relevant glucose-lowering activity while 
      promoting weight loss, a unique dual effect among oral antidiabetic agents. 
      Furthermore, the combination of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other drugs that either 
      have anorectic effects (such as incretin-based therapies) or reduce hepatic 
      glucose output (like metformin) and, thus, may dampen these two compensatory 
      mechanisms appears appealing for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

PG  - F184-F191

AB  - In experimental models of diabetes, augmented sodium-glucose cotransport-2 
      (SGLT2) activity diminishes sodium (Na(+)) delivery at the macula densa. As a 
      result, less vasoconstrictive adenosine is generated, leading to afferent 
      arteriolar vasodilatation and hyperfiltration. The measurement and significance 
      of urinary adenosine in humans has not been examined extensively in states of 
      renal hemodynamic impairment like that of diabetes. Our aim was to validate a 
      method for urine adenosine quantification in humans and perform an exploratory 
      post hoc analysis to determine whether urinary adenosine levels change 
      dynamically in response to natriuresis in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) 
      before and after treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin. We 
      hypothesized that SGLT2i, which reduces renal hyperfiltration through increased 
      Na(+) delivery to the macula densa, would increase urinary adenosine excretion. 
      Urine adenosine corrected for creatinine was measured using our validated liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method in 40 healthy 
      participants and 40 patients with T1D. In the T1D cohort, measurements were 
      performed during clamped euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions before and 
      following 8 wk of SGLT2i therapy. Urinary adenosine was detectable in healthy 
      subjects (0.32 ± 0.11 µmol/mmol Cr) and patients with T1D. In response to SGLT2i, 
      urine adenosine increased during clamped hyperglycemia (0.40 ± 0.11 vs. 0.45 ± 
      0.12 µmol/mmol Cr, P = 0.005). Similar trends were observed during clamped 
      euglycemia (P = 0.08). In conclusion, SGLT2i increases urinary adenosine 
      excretion under clamped hyperglycemic conditions in patients with T1D. The 
      potentially protective role of SGLT2i against glomerular hyperfiltration and its 
      mediation by adenosine in diabetes merits further study.

AB  - Background Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduce hospitalizations for 
      heart failure and cardiovascular death, although the underlying mechanisms have 
      not been resolved. The SIMPLE trial (The Effects of Empagliflozin on Myocardial 
      Flow Reserve in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) investigated the effects 
      of empagliflozin on myocardial flow reserve (MFR) reflecting microvascular 
      perfusion, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high cardiovascular 
      disease risk. Methods and Results We randomized 90 patients to either 
      empagliflozin 25 mg once daily or placebo for 13 weeks, as add-on to standard 
      therapy. The primary outcome was change in MFR at week 13, quantified by 
      Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The secondary key 
      outcomes were changes in resting rate-pressure product adjusted MFR, changes to 
      myocardial flow during rest and stress, and reversible cardiac ischemia. Mean 
      baseline MFR was 2.21 (95% CI, 2.08-2.35). There was no change from baseline in 
      MFR at week 13 in either the empagliflozin: 0.01 (95% CI, -0.18 to 0.21) or 
      placebo groups: 0.06 (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.27), with no treatment effect -0.05 (95% 
      CI, -0.33 to 0.23). No effects on the secondary outcome parameters by Rubidium-82 
      positron emission tomography/computed tomography was observed. Treatment with 
      empagliflozin reduced hemoglobin A(1c) by 0.76% (95% CI, 1.0-0.5; P<0.001) and 
      increased hematocrit by 1.69% (95% CI, 0.7-2.6; P<0.001). Conclusions 
      Empagliflozin did not improve MFR among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      and high cardiovascular disease risk. The present study does not support that 
      short-term improvement in MFR explains the reduction in cardiovascular events 
      observed in the outcome trials. Registration URL:

AB  - AIM: This Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated 
      the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Four hundred and eight patients 
      (treatment-naïve or after a 4-week wash-out period) were randomized to receive 
      empagliflozin 5, 10 or 25 mg once daily, placebo or open-label metformin for 
      12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 
      12 weeks. RESULTS: After 12 weeks' treatment, empagliflozin showed dose-dependent 
      reductions in HbA1c from baseline [5 mg: -0.4%, 10 mg: -0.5%, 25 mg: -0.6%; all 
      doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.09%)]. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased 
      with empagliflozin [5 mg: -1.29 mmol/l, 10 mg: -1.61 mmol/l, 25 mg: -1.72 mmol/l; 
      all doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.04 mmol/l)]. Body weight decreased in all 
      empagliflozin groups (all doses p < 0.001 vs. placebo). The incidence of adverse 
      events (AEs) was similar in the placebo (32.9%) and empagliflozin (29.1%) groups. 
      The most frequently reported AEs on empagliflozin were pollakiuria (3.3% vs. 0% 
      for placebo), thirst (3.3% vs. 0% for placebo) and nasopharyngitis (2.0% vs. 1.2% 
      for placebo). AEs consistent with urinary tract infections (UTIs) were reported 
      in four (1.6%) patients on empagliflozin vs. one (1.2%) on placebo. Genital 
      infections were reported in five (2%) patients on empagliflozin vs. 0% on 
      placebo. No UTIs or genital infections led to premature discontinuation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin resulted in 
      dose-dependent, clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and FPG, and reductions 
      in body weight compared with placebo. Empagliflozin was well-tolerated with a 
      favourable safety profile.

AB  - Optimization of extraction and chromatographic conditions is essential for the 
      simultaneous analysis of drugs having different physico-chemical properties, 
      especially for in vivo applications. The present work describes concurrent 
      estimation of metformin (MET) and three sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitors namely canagliflozin (CANA), dapagliflozin (DAPA) and empagliflozin 
      (EMPA) in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). Sample clean-up was optimized using ion-pair solid-phase extraction 
      with sodium lauryl sulphate on Strata-X extraction cartridges. Consistent 
      recoveries were obtained by critically optimizing parameters such as washing and 
      elution solvents during extraction. The extraction recovery ranged from 79 to 88% 
      for all the analytes. Chromatographic separation were accomplished on a Cyano 
      (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column within 5.0 min using acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium 
      formate buffer (75:25, v/v) as the mobile phase. The resolution factors between 
      MET-EMPA, MET-DAPA, MET-CANA, DAPA-EMPA and CANA-DAPA were 4.92, 5.85, 7.13, 1.01 
      and 1.44, respectively. Calibration curves were linear in the concentration range 
      of 2.00-2000, 3.00-3000, 0.20-200 and 1.50-1500 ng/mL for MET, CANA, DAPA and 
      EMPA, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a polarity 
      switching approach to achieve high sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring 
      mode. The method was validated using current regulatory guidelines and applied to 
      study the pharmacokinetics of fixed-dose formulations of MET and SGLT-2 
      inhibitors in healthy subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The discovery of Sodium-Glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 
      had rewritten the treatment of diabetes mellitus with an impressive fall in the 
      incidence of death and associated complications. INTRODUCTION: The SGLT2 
      inhibitors by inhibiting the SGLT2 in the proximal nephron, helps in reducing the 
      reabsorption of approximately 90% of the filtered glucose and increased urinary 
      glucose excretion (UGE). METHODS: The literature related to SGLT2 inhibitors has 
      been thoroughly explored from various available public domains and reviewed 
      extensively for this article. Detailed and updated information related to SGLT2 
      inhibitors with a major focus on the recently approved Ertuglifolzin is 
      structured in this review. RESULT: The present review is an effort to understand 
      the management of diabetes mellitus over the past few decades with a special 
      focus on the role of SGLT2 receptor in the causes of therapeutic and preventive 
      strategies for diabetes mellitus. Pragmatic placement of the currently available 
      Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, and Empagliflozin as oral antidiabetic agents has 
      been done. Well accommodated stereochemistry and a high docking score of 
      Ertugliflozin in ligand-receptor simulation studies attribute to its high 
      potency. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the unique mechanism of SGLT2 
      Inhibitors coupled with pleiotropic benefits on weight and blood pressure, which 
      make it an attractive choice of therapy to diabetic patients, not controlled by 
      other medications.

TI  - A Population Pharmacokinetic Study to Compare a Novel Empagliflozin L-Proline 
      Formulation with Its Conventional Formulation in Healthy Subjects.
LID - 10.3390/ph17040522 [doi]
LID - 522
AB  - Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that is 
      commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). CKD-370 was 
      newly developed as a cocrystal formulation of empagliflozin with co-former 
      L-proline, which has been confirmed to be bioequivalent in South Korea. This 
      study aimed to quantify the differences in the absorption phase and 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of two empagliflozin formulations in healthy 
      subjects by using population PK analysis. The plasma concentration data of 
      empagliflozin were obtained from two randomized, open-label, crossover, phase 1 
      clinical studies in healthy Korean subjects after a single-dose administration. A 
      population PK model was constructed by using a nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) 
      approach (Monolix Suite 2021R1). Interindividual variability (IIV) and 
      interoccasion variability (IOV) were investigated. The final model was evaluated 
      by goodness-of-fit (GOF) diagnostic plots, visual predictive checks (VPCs), 
      prediction errors, and bootstrapping. The PK of empagliflozin was adequately 
      described with a two-compartment combined transit compartment model with 
      first-order absorption and elimination. Log-transformed body weight significantly 
      influenced systemic clearance (CL) and the volume of distribution in the 
      peripheral compartment (V2) of empagliflozin. GOF plots, VPCs, prediction errors, 
      and the bootstrapping of the final model suggested that the proposed model was 
      adequate and robust, with good precision at different dose strengths. The 
      cocrystal form did not affect the absorption phase of the drug, and the PK 
      parameters were not affected by the different treatments.

AB  - Previously we investigated the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and 
      pharmacologic properties of all six sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 
      inhibitors commercially available in Japan using normal and diabetic mice. We 
      classified the SGLT2 inhibitors with respect to duration of action as either 
      long-acting (ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin) or intermediate-acting 
      (tofogliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and luseogliflozin). In the present 
      study, antidiabetic effects of repeated administration of these SGLT2 inhibitors 
      in type 2 diabetic mice were investigated. When repeatedly administered for 4 
      weeks, all SGLT2 inhibitors significantly exhibited antihyperglycemic, 
      antihyperinsulinemic, and pancreas-protective effects, as well as insulin 
      resistance-improving effects. When compared at doses producing comparable 
      reduction in hyperglycemia across all drugs, the antidiabetic effects of 
      ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin were more potent than those of the other four 
      drugs, but these differences among the six drugs were not statistically 
      significant. Further, an oral glucose tolerance test performed after repeated 
      administration demonstrated significant improvement in glucose tolerance only 
      with ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin, implying improved insulin resistance and 
      secretion. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, although all SGLT2 
      inhibitors exert antidiabetic effects in type 2 diabetic mice, these 
      pharmacologic effects might be slightly superior with the long-acting drugs, 
      which are able to provide favorable blood glucose control throughout the day.

AB  - Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is one of the important targets against 
      type II diabetes mellitus. A typical SGLT2 inhibitor acts by inhibiting glucose 
      reabsorption, thus lowering the blood glucose level. Unlike SGLT1, SGLT2 is 
      responsible for almost 90% glucose reabsorption from glomerular filtrate. The 
      current SGLT2 inhibitors include gliflozins, often prescribed as second or 
      third-line agents in diabetes mellitus. The SGLT2 inhibitors also benefit 
      patients with heart and kidney disease. Due to instability issues with the 
      natural O-aryl glycoside analogues C-glycoside analogues were developed and 
      showed improved stability. Despite enhanced bioavailability and selectivity of 
      newer derivatives, some serious side effects are associated with gliflozin 
      analogues. At the present study, we applied in-silico approaches to find new 
      glycomimetic compounds as potent SGLT2 inhibitors that could show improvement in 
      side effects associated with current analogues. This work applied both 
      ligand-based and structure-based drug approaches to find potential compounds. We 
      developed a 3D-QSAR method to screen potential inhibitors from a library of ten 
      thousand compounds and performed docking studies. The compounds were ranked based 
      on predicted pIC50 and docking score. An initial screening of five thousand 
      compounds was conducted, and the subsequently selected top 12 compounds were 
      based on binding free energy calculations. These selected compounds were 
      subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Remarkably, our simulations 
      identified nine compounds that exhibited significant and sustained binding 
      affinity compared to the co-crystallized Empagliflozin. Collectively, considering 
      the anticipated pharmacokinetic profiles and toxicity assessments, several of 
      these compounds emerged as promising candidates for further in-depth evaluation.

AB  - The effect of empagliflozin (EMPA), a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor 
      (SGLT2i), on the structure of endocrine pancreas in pre-diabetes (Pre-DM) is not 
      yet elucidated. In the current study the relatively enlarged islets of Langerhans 
      seen in the Pre-DM group was restored to control size by administration of EMPA. 
      In addition the disbalance in the percentage of β-cells and α-cells in islets of 
      the Pre-DM was corrected in the Pre-DM + EMPA group with reversal of the 
      significantly increased islet mass, β-cell mass and neogenesis. Administrating 
      EMPA in Pre-DM decreased level of caspase-3, increased that of Bcl-2 to control 
      level and reduced the significantly increased inflammatory cytokines to levels 
      approximated to those of the control group. In Pre-DM + EMPA group, EMPA had 
      efficiently restored the significantly impaired glucose hemostasis to levels 
      nearly similar to those of the control animals. This may indicate that the 
      modulatory effect of EMPA on cells of the islets in Pre-DM is associated with a 
      local pleotropic effect on inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Tofogliflozin is a novel selective inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) and has been developed for the treatment of patients 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the 
      quantitation of tofogliflozin in rat plasma was developed and validated. The 
      detection was performed using an API 3200 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer 
      with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in the positive electrospray ionization 
      mode. The SRM transitions were m/z=387.1 [M+H](+)→267.1 for tofogliflozin and 
      m/z=451.2 [M+H](+)→71.0 for empagliflozin (internal standard: I.S.). 
      Chromatographic separation was performed on a Quicksorb ODS (2.1mm i.d.×150mm, 
      5μm size) using isocratic elution with acetonitrile/10mM ammonium acetate (50:50, 
      v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2mL/min and the total run time was 
      4.0min. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for tofogliflozin was 0.5ng/mL 
      with sufficient specificity, accuracy, and precision. The validated method was 
      successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic studies of tofogliflozin in rats. 
      This assay method could be a valuable tool for future studies including 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of SGLT2 inhibitors.

AB  - AIMS: To provide model-based clinical development decision support including dose 
      selection guidance for empagliflozin, an orally administered sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitor, through developed exposure-response (E-R) models for 
      efficacy and tolerability in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      METHODS: Five randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple oral dose studies of 
      empagliflozin in patients with T2DM (n = 974; 1-100 mg once daily, duration ≤12 
      weeks) were used to develop E-R models for efficacy (glycosylated haemoglobin 
      [HbA1c ], fasting plasma glucose [FPG] and urinary glucose excretion). Two 
      studies (n = 748, 12 weeks) were used to evaluate tolerability E-R. RESULTS: The 
      efficacy model predicted maximal decreases in FPG and HbA1c of 16% and 0.6%, 
      respectively, assuming a baseline FPG concentration of 8 mm (144 mg dl(-1) ) and 
      10-25 mg every day empagliflozin targeted 80-90% of these maximums. Increases in 
      exposure had no effect on incidence rates of hypoglycaemia (n = 4), urinary tract 
      infection (n = 17) or genital/vulvovaginal-related (n = 16) events, although low 
      prevalence rates may have precluded more accurate evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: E-R 
      analyses indicated that 10 and 25 mg once daily empagliflozin doses achieved near 
      maximal glucose lowering efficacy.

AB  - Inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 with empagliflozin results in 
      caloric loss by increasing urinary glucose excretion and has a mild diuretic 
      effect. Diuretic effects are usually associated with reflex-mediated increases in 
      sympathetic tone, whereas caloric loss is associated with decreased sympathetic 
      tone. In an open-label trial, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) (burst 
      frequency, burst incidence, and total MSNA) was assessed using microneurography 
      performed off-treatment and on day 4 of treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg once 
      daily in 22 metformin-treated patients with type II diabetes (mean [range] age 54 
      [40-65] years). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate, urine 
      volume, and body weight were assessed before and on day 4 (BP, heart rate), day 5 
      (urine volume), or day 6 (body weight) of treatment with empagliflozin. After 
      4 days of treatment with empagliflozin, no significant changes in MSNA were 
      apparent despite a numerical increase in urine volume, numerical reductions in 
      BP, and significant weight loss. There were no clinically relevant changes in 
      heart rate. Empagliflozin is not associated with clinically relevant 
      reflex-mediated sympathetic activation in contrast to increases observed with 
      diuretics in other studies. Our study suggests a novel mechanism through which 
      sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition affects human autonomic cardiovascular 
      regulation.

TI  - Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Inhibition Stimulates Distal Tubular Natriuresis and 
      Increases in Circulating SDF-1α(1-67) in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.
PG  - 1073-1081
LID - 10.2337/dc17-0061 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antihyperglycemic agents, such as empagliflozin, stimulate proximal 
      tubular natriuresis and improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes. Because dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are used 
      in combination with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, we 
      examined whether and how sitagliptin modulates fractional sodium excretion and 
      renal and systemic hemodynamic function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 
      32 patients with type 2 diabetes in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trial. Measurements of renal tubular function and renal and 
      systemic hemodynamics were obtained at baseline, then hourly after one dose of 
      sitagliptin or placebo, and repeated at 1 month. Fractional excretion of sodium 
      and lithium and renal hemodynamic function were measured during clamped 
      euglycemia. Systemic hemodynamics were measured using noninvasive cardiac output 
      monitoring, and plasma levels of intact versus cleaved stromal cell-derived 
      factor (SDF)-1α were quantified using immunoaffinity and tandem mass 
      spectrometry. RESULTS: Sitagliptin did not change fractional lithium excretion 
      but significantly increased total fractional sodium excretion (1.32 ± 0.5 to 1.80 
      ± 0.01% vs. 2.15 ± 0.6 vs. 2.02 ± 1.0%, P = 0.012) compared with placebo after 1 
      month of treatment. Moreover, sitagliptin robustly increased intact plasma 
      SDF-1α(1-67) and decreased truncated plasma SDF-1α(3-67). Renal hemodynamic 
      function, systemic blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and total 
      peripheral resistance were not adversely affected by sitagliptin. CONCLUSIONS: 
      DPP-4 inhibition promotes a distal tubular natriuresis in conjunction with 
      increased levels of intact SDF-1α(1-67). Because of the distal location of the 
      natriuretic effect, DPP-4 inhibition does not affect tubuloglomerular feedback or 
      impair renal hemodynamic function, findings relevant to using DPP-4 inhibitors 
      for treating type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Silica-coated magnetic iron oxide functionalized with hydrophobic polymeric ionic 
      liquid: a promising nanoscale sorbent for simultaneous extraction of antidiabetic 
      drugs from human plasma prior to their quantitation by HPLC.
PG  - 30550-30561
LID - 10.1039/c8ra02109k [doi]
AB  - Herein, silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles modified with imidazolium-based 
      polymeric ionic liquid (Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2)@PIL) were fabricated as a sustainable 
      sorbent for magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) and simultaneous determination 
      of trace antidiabetic drugs in human plasma by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The Fe(3)O(4) core was 
      functionalized by silica (SiO(2)) and vinyl layers where the ionic liquid 
      1-vinyl-3-octylimidazolium bromide (VOIM-Br) was attached through a free radical 
      copolymerization process. In order to achieve hydrophobic magnetic nanoparticles 
      and increase the merits of the sorbent, Br(-) anions were synthetically replaced 
      with PF(6) (-). The properties and morphology of the sorbent were characterized 
      by various techniques and all the results illustrated the prosperous synthesis of 
      Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2)@PIL. A comprehensive study was carried out to investigate and 
      optimize various parameters affecting the extraction efficiency. The limit of 
      detection (LOD, S/N = 3) for empagliflozin, metformin and canagliflozin was 1.3, 
      6.0 and 0.8 ng mL(-1), respectively. Linearity (0.997 ≥ r (2) ≥ 0.993) and linear 
      concentration ranges of 5.0-1200.0, 20.0-1800.0 and 5.0-1000.0 ng mL(-1) were 
      obtained for empagliflozin, metformin and canagliflozin, respectively. 
      Intra-assay (3.8-7.5%, n = 9) and inter-assay (3.2-8.5%, n = 12) precisions as 
      well as accuracies (≤9.1%) displayed good efficiency of the method. Finally, the 
      method was applied for the quantitation of antidiabetic drugs in human plasma 
      after oral administration and main pharmacokinetic data including T (max) (h), C 
      (max) (ng mL(-1)), AUC(0-24) (ng h mL(-1)), AUC(0-∞) (ng h mL(-1)), and T (1/2) 
      (h) were evaluated.

TI  - Optimization of empagliflozin immediate release tablets (10 mg) using central 
      composite rotatable design with response surface methodology.
PG  - 1519-1525
AB  - Empagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of sodium glucose co-transporter II, given 
      as mono therapy or an add-on treatment to reduce the glycated hemoglobin levels 
      in type 2 diabetes. This work deals with designing, formulating and optimizing 
      empagliflozin (10mg) immediate release (IR) tablets by direct compression 
      technique using different excipients. Through central composite rotatable design 
      (CCRD), total nine formulations (EF1-EF9) were generated by changing the 
      composition of binder avicel PH 102® (X1) and superdisintegrant acdisol⌖ (X2). 
      Formulation runs with in suitable weight range and powder properties were 
      subjected to compression. The influence of interaction of excipients on 
      friability (Y1), hardness (Y2) and disintegration (Y3) were analyzed by fitting 
      the polynomial quadratic model with response surface methodology (RSM). Trials 
      EF2, EF7, EF8 and EF9 exhibited acceptable tablet attributes upon 
      physico-chemical testing. Different dissolution models were applied to observe 
      the in vitro drug release pattern in phosphate buffer of pH 6.8. The cumulative 
      drug release of IR tablet batches followed the Weibull kinetics with regression 
      coefficient (r2) values of 0.983-0.992. Empagliflozin trials were exposed to 
      accelerated storage conditions (40±2°C/ 75±5% RH) for stability testing. Shelf 
      life period of exposed formulations were computed in range of 22 to 25 months. 
      Keeping in view of the results, it is concluded that the employed technique of 
      preparation and optimization are observed to be excellent for developing 
      immediate release empagliflozin (10mg) tablets.

      autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by an insulin receptor mutation 
      (INSR; 147,670). Due to the rarity and complexity of the disease, we have few 
      therapeutic alternatives other than insulin with clinical studies with robust 
      evidence. Some reports suggest the adjunct use of metreleptin, metformin, and 
      pioglitazone with improved glycemic control, however, with results still 
      unsatisfactory for the desirable glycemic targets for this age group. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: We report a case of an 11-year-old patient who was diagnosed with 
      RMS at 6 years of age, confirmed through genetic sequencing, with unsatisfactory 
      glycemic control despite the use of >5 IU/kg/day of insulin, pioglitazone, and 
      metformin. To optimize therapy, we used empagliflozin (SGLT2i) to correct 
      hyperglycemia. With the use of the drug, we obtained a decrease of almost 3% in 
      the value of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and about 30% reduction in the total 
      daily dose of insulin. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: In this specific case, considering 
      the glycosuric effects independent of the functionality of insulin receptors 
      (which in this case had partial activity due to the INSR gene mutation), an 
      improvement in glycemic control was obtained, with optimization of HbA1c without 
      documented or reported adverse effects. From this isolated case and understanding 
      the pharmacokinetics of this drug class, the question remains whether it would be 
      possible to use this treatment in other situations of SIR where we also have few 
      therapeutic perspectives.

AB  - Ubiquitin specific protease 30 (USP30) has been attributed to mitochondrial 
      dysfunction and impediment of mitophagy in Parkinson's disease (PD). This happens 
      once ubiquitin that supposed to bind with deformed mitochondria at the insistence 
      of Parkin, it's been recruited by USP30 via the distal ubiquitin binding domain. 
      This is a challenge when PINK1 and Parkin loss their functions due to mutation. 
      Although, there are reports on USP30s' inhibitors but no study on the repurposing 
      of inhibitors approved against MMP-9 and SGLT-2 as potential inhibitors of USP30 
      in PD. Thus, the highlight therein, is to repurpose approved inhibitors of MMP-9 
      and SGLT-2 against USP30 in PD using extensive computational modelling framework. 
      3D structures of Ligands and USP30 were obtained from PubChem and protein 
      database (PDB) servers respectively, and were subjected to molecular docking, 
      ADMET evaluation, DFT calculation, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and free 
      energy calculations. Out of the 18 drugs, 2 drugs showed good binding affinity to 
      the distal ubiquitin binding domain, moderate pharmacokinetic properties and good 
      stability. The findings showed canagliflozin and empagliflozin as potential 
      inhibitors of USP30. Thus, we present these drugs as repurposing candidates for 
      the treatment of PD. However, the findings in this current study needs to be 
      validated experimentally.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is the end stage of cardiovascular disease. Because of its 
      complex condition and poor prognosis, HF has become an important public health 
      problem in the world. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) is a member of the 
      glucose transporter family. Recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have been applied to treat 
      HF. In this study, the main aim was to discover natural SGLT2 inhibitor from 
      Chinese herbs through docking-based virtual screening. Totally 113 natural 
      compounds of potential SGLT2 inhibitor were identified, which displayed docking 
      affinity higher than six approved inhibitors (dapagliflozin (IC50 = 4.9 nM), 
      canagliflozin (IC50 = 4.4 nM 6.7), ipragliflozin (IC50 = 7.4 nM), empagliflozin 
      (IC50 = 3.1 nM), tofogliflozin (IC50 = 4 nM) and luseogliflozin (IC50 = 2.3 nM)) 
      through docking-based virtual screening. Then, the top three hits (ZINC70455591, 
      ZINC85594065 and ZINC14588133) and six known inhibitors were selected for 
      molecular dynamics simulation and the binding free energy calculation using 
      molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area to demonstrate the stability 
      and affinity of docked complexes. These results pointed out that the three docked 
      complexes were stabilized and the chosen compounds were tightly adhering to the 
      binding site of SGLT2. Besides, pharmacokinetic properties of the selected 
      compounds showed those natural compounds may be potential drug candidates. This 
      study may be contributed to further in vitro and in vivo validation and the 
      development of novel SGLT2 inhibitor for treating HF.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TI  - Pharmacometrics enhanced Bayesian borrowing approach to improve clinical trial 
      efficiency: Case of empagliflozin in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1386-1397
LID - 10.1002/psp4.13035 [doi]
AB  - We report use of a pharmacometrics enhanced Bayesian borrowing (PEBB) approach to 
      leverage historical clinical trial data on a drug product to build models, 
      project the outcome of future clinical trials, and borrow information from these 
      projections to improve the efficiency of future target trials. This design takes 
      a two-stage approach. First, a design phase is performed before target trial data 
      are available to determine the operating characteristics and an appropriate 
      tuning parameter that will be used in the subsequent analysis phase of a chosen 
      target trial. Second, once the target trial data are available, the analysis 
      phase is performed with the determined tuning parameter. This step is where 
      borrowing is applied from these projections to inform the results for the target 
      trial. To illustrate how a PEBB could improve the efficiency of clinical trials, 
      we apply our design to trials with empagliflozin for treating patients with type 
      2 diabetes. We performed a retrospective evaluation applying the method to a 
      phase III target trial and a hypothetical smaller trial. The type I error could 
      be kept below 10% while increasing the trial power and effective sample size. Our 
      findings suggest that a PEBB has the potential to increase the power of clinical 
      trials, while controlling for type I error, by leveraging the information from 
      previous trials through population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and 
      simulation.

      inhibitors.
PG  - 937-943

AB  - Objectives: In Japan, sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 
      have been reported to be associated with serious skin and subcutaneous tissue 
      disorders. A post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study suggested that the 
      association was specific for ipragliflozin and, to a lesser extent for 
      dapagliflozin. These studies were performed to confirm the association of 6 SGLT2 
      inhibitors with serious skin disorders in a clinical setting, to elucidate the 
      role of melanin in serious skin disorders and to understand the underlying 
      mechanisms. Methods: The latest PMS records were retrieved from the Japanese 
      Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database, and the associations were analyzed by 
      data mining techniques. In silico 3-D docking simulation of SGLT2 inhibitors with 
      melanin was performed using the MOE software. The skin tissue distribution of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors was evaluated using albino rats after oral administration at 
      clinical doses. Results: The adjusted reporting odds ratio (95% confidential 
      limit) was 1.667 (1.415, 1.963) for ipragliflozin, 0.514 (0.317, 0.835) for 
      dapagliflozin, 0.149 (0.048, 0.465) for tofogliflozin, 0.624 (0.331, 1.177) for 
      luseogliflozin, 0.590 (0.277, 1.257) for canagliflozin and 0.293 (0.073, 1.187) 
      for empagliflozin, when drugs other than the SGLT2 inhibitors were referred, and 
      the association was detected only for ipragliflozin in clinical use. In silico 
      3-D docking simulation suggested the influence of melanin in 
      ipragliflozin-specific serious skin disorders. The skin tissue-to-plasma 
      concentration ratio of ipragliflozin was 0.45 ± 0.20 (±SD) at 1 hr after 
      administration and increased in a time-dependent manner to 5.82 ± 3.66 at 24 hr 
      (p<0.05), but not in case of other SGLT2 inhibitors. Conclusions: Serious skin 
      disorders were suggested to be specific for ipragliflozin. Interaction with 
      melanin might be implicated in ipragliflozin-specific serious skin disorders. 
      Ipragliflozin was retained in the skin tissue, which suggested its interaction 
      with the skin tissue in serious skin disorders.

TI  - Shift to Fatty Substrate Utilization in Response to Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter

AB  - Pharmacologically induced glycosuria elicits adaptive responses in glucose 
      homeostasis and hormone release. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), along with decrements 
      in plasma glucose and insulin levels and increments in glucagon release, 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors induce stimulation of 
      endogenous glucose production (EGP) and a suppression of tissue glucose disposal 
      (TGD). We measured fasting and postmeal glucose fluxes in 25 subjects without 
      diabetes using a double glucose tracer technique; in these subjects and in 66 
      previously reported patients with T2D, we also estimated lipolysis (from 
      [(2)H5]glycerol turnover rate and circulating free fatty acids, glycerol, and 
      triglycerides), lipid oxidation (LOx; by indirect calorimetry), and ketogenesis 
      (from circulating β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations). In both groups, 
      empagliflozin administration raised EGP, lowered TGD, and stimulated lipolysis, 
      LOx, and ketogenesis. The pattern of glycosuria-induced changes was similar in 
      subjects without diabetes and in those with T2D but quantitatively smaller in the 
      former. With chronic (4 weeks) versus acute (first dose) drug administration, 
      glucose flux responses were attenuated, whereas lipid responses were enhanced; in 
      patients with T2D, fasting β-hydroxybutyrate levels rose from 246 ± 288 to 561 ± 
      596 µmol/L (P < 0.01). We conclude that by shunting substantial amounts of 
      carbohydrate into urine, SGLT2-mediated glycosuria results in a progressive shift 
      in fuel utilization toward fatty substrates. The associated hormonal milieu 
      (lower insulin-to-glucagon ratio) favors glucose release and ketogenesis.

AB  - Ipragliflozin is a highly potent and selective sodium-dependent glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, a novel class of hypoglycemic agents. The aim 
      of the present study was to establish a new highly sensitive and rapid liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantitative 
      analysis of ipragliflozin in rat plasma and apply this method to a 
      pharmacokinetic study in rats. Empagliflozin was used as an internal standard 
      (I.S.) and liquid-liquid extraction was conducted using tert-butyl methyl ether. 
      Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a Quicksorb ODS (2.1mm i.d.×150mm, 
      5μm in size) with acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 
      0.2mL/min. An API 3200 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the 
      positive electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring was used 
      to detect ipragliflozin and I.S. transitions: m/z 422.0 [M+NH4](+)→151.0 for 
      ipragliflozin and m/z 451.2 [M+H](+)→71.0 for I.S. Inter- and intra-day 
      accuracies and precisions were within ±15%. This validated method was 
      successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of ipragliflozin in rats. This 
      assay method may contribute to assessment of novel SGLT2 inhibitors using the rat 
      as an animal model.

TI  - A Case of SGLT2 Inhibitor-Associated Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis Following 
      Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery.
PG  - 20-22
LID - 10.1016/j.aace.2020.11.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel group of 
      oral hypoglycemic agents with multiple proven beneficial effects. However, their 
      use has been associated with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), typically 
      triggered by risk factors such as acute illness, surgery, and decreased calorie 
      intake. Therefore, it is recommended that patients discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors 
      at least 24 hours before surgery to minimize this risk. We report a case of a 
      postoperative euglycemic DKA in a patient who had discontinued SGLT2 inhibitor 
      therapy 48 hours prior to surgery. METHODS: We describe the clinical course of a 
      patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus on empagliflozin therapy who was referred 
      for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. RESULTS: A 60-year-old man with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus developed euglycemic DKA a few hours after coronary artery 
      bypass graft surgery. Laboratory results showed acute postoperative elevated 
      anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal glucose and elevated blood ketone 
      levels. It was later revealed that the patient was treated as an outpatient with 
      empagliflozin; the last dose was taken 48 hours prior to his procedure. 
      CONCLUSION: Euglycemic DKA can occur postoperatively in patients with a history 
      of SGLT2 inhibitor use, even 48 hours after the discontinuation of therapy. This 
      case highlights the need to revisit the recommended time to discontinue these 
      agents, specifically prior to major surgery, because their pharmacokinetic 
      effects may persist after 24 hours of discontinuation, putting patients at risk 
      for postoperative euglycemic DKA.

TI  - The effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 
      diabetes: protocol for a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised 
      trials.
PG  - e005378
LID - e005378
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) increase 
      urinary glucose excretion through a reduced renal glucose reabsorption. We plan 
      to perform a systematic review of SGLT-2i for treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review with meta-analyses of randomised 
      clinical trials on SGLT-2i versus placebo, other oral glucose lowering drugs or 
      insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes will be performed. The primary end 
      point will be the glycated haemoglobin. Secondary end points will include changes 
      in body weight, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, plasma cholesterol, 
      kidney and liver blood tests, blood pressure and adverse events. Electronic (the 
      Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Science Citation Index) and manual 
      searches will be performed. Meta-analyses will be performed and the results 
      presented as mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk differences for 
      dichotomous outcomes, both with 95% CIs. Subgroup, sensitivity, regression and 
      sequential analyses will be performed to evaluate intertrial heterogeneity, bias 
      and the robustness of results due to cumulative testing. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The study will contribute to the knowledge regarding the 
      beneficial and harmful effects of SGLT-2i in patients with type 2 diabetes. We 
      plan to publish the study irrespective of the results. RESULTS: The study will be 
      disseminated by peer-review publication and conference presentation. TRIAL

TI  - A validated LC-MS/MS method for the determination of canagliflozin, a 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, in a lower volume of rat 
      plasma: application to pharmacokinetic studies in rats.

AB  - Canagliflozin is a novel, orally selective inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. In this study, a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantitative analysis of canagliflozin in 
      a lower volume of rat plasma (0.1 mL) was established and applied to a 
      pharmacokinetic study in rats. Following liquid-liquid extraction by tert-butyl 
      methyl ether, chromatographic separation of canagliflozin was performed on a 
      Quicksorb ODS (2.1 mm i.d. × 150 mm, 5 µm size) using acetonitrile-0.1% formic 
      acid (90:10, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The detection 
      was carried out using an API 3200 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer operating 
      in the positive electrospray ionization mode. Selected ion monitoring transitions 
      of m/z = 462.0 [M + NH4 ](+)  → 191.0 for canagliflozin and m/z = 451.2 
      [M + H](+)  → 71.0 for empagliflozin (internal standard) were obtained. The 
      validation of the method was investigated, and it was found to be of sufficient 
      specificity, accuracy and precision. Canagliflozin in rat plasma was stable under 
      the analytical conditions used. This validated method was successfully applied to 
      assess the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin in rats using 0.1 mL rat plasma.
