TI  - Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Bioequivalence of Two Empagliflozin Formulations 
      after Single Oral Administration under Fasting and Fed Conditions in Healthy 
      Chinese Subjects: An Open-label Randomized Single-dose Two-sequence, 
      Two-treatment, Two-period Crossover Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of 
      empagliflozin, and the bioequivalence of test formulation empagliflozin tablet 
      compared with the brand-name drug Jardiance (reference formulation) after single 
      oral administration under fasting and fed conditions in healthy Chinese subjects. 
      METHODS: An open-label randomized single-dose two-sequence, two-treatment, 
      two-period crossover study was conducted in healthy Chinese subjects, with 30 
      subjects under fasting condition and another 30 subjects under fed condition. 
      Under each condition, subjects received a single oral administration of either 
      the test or reference empagliflozin formulation, and then they received a single 
      oral dose of the other formulation after a 7-day washout period. RESULTS: A total 
      of 29 subjects under each condition completed the study. The maximum plasma drug 
      concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 
      t (AUC(0-t) ), and the AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-∞) ) of test formulation and 
      reference formulation was 186.90 ± 47.21 and 190.60 ± 40.94 ng/ml, 
      1303.04 ± 234.28 and 1267.78 ± 217.07 ng·hour/ml, and 1328.08 ± 243.84 and 
      1293.22 ± 224.82 ng·hour/ml under fasting condition, and 151.55 ± 23.86 and 
      154.08 ± 30.40 ng/ml, 1215.65 ± 197.62 and 1199.26 ± 186.23 ng·hour/ml, and 
      1241.76 ± 202.47 and 1225.54 ± 192.10 ng·hour/ml under fed condition, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The two formulations of empagliflozin were 
      bioequivalent, and both were generally well tolerated under fasting and fed 
      conditions.

PG  - 215-22
LID - 10.1111/dom.12182 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Empagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitor that inhibits renal glucose reabsorption and is being investigated for 
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In this open-label 
      study, the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics 
      and safety of a 50 mg dose of empagliflozin was investigated in 40 subjects, 
      grouped according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: 
      Maximum empagliflozin plasma concentrations were similar in subjects with normal 
      renal function and renal impairment. Area under the empagliflozin 
      concentration-time curve (AUC0 -∞ ) values increased by approximately 18, 20, 66 
      and 48% in subjects with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and renal 
      failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD), respectively, in comparison to healthy 
      subjects. This was attributed to decreased renal clearance (CLR ). Urinary 
      glucose excretion (UGE) decreased with increasing renal impairment and correlated 
      with decreased eGFR and CLR . Empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increase 
      in adverse events associated with renal impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Renal 
      insufficiency resulted in decreased CLR of empagliflozin, moderately increased 
      systemic exposure and decreased UGE. A single 50 mg dose of empagliflozin was 
      well tolerated in subjects with normal renal function and any degree of renal 
      impairment. The pharmacokinetic results of this study indicate that no dose 
      adjustment of empagliflozin is required in patients with renal impairment.

TI  - Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of 
      empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in healthy 
      Japanese subjects.
PG  - 213-9
AB  - This randomized, placebo-controlled within dose groups, double-blind, single 
      rising dose study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of 1 mg to 100 mg doses of empagliflozin in 48 healthy Japanese 
      male subjects. Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, reaching peak levels in 1.25 
      to 2.50 h; thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic fashion, with 
      mean terminal elimination half-life ranging from 7.76 to 11.7 h. Increase in 
      empagliflozin exposure was proportional to dose. Oral clearance was dose 
      independent and ranged from 140 to 172 mL/min. In the 24 h following 100 mg 
      empagliflozin administration, the mean (%CV) amount of glucose excreted in urine 
      was 74.3 (17.1) g. The amount and the maximum rate of glucose excreted via urine 
      increased with dose of empagliflozin. Nine adverse events, all of mild intensity, 
      were reported by 8 subjects (7 with empagliflozin and 1 with the placebo). No 
      hypoglycemia was reported. In conclusion, 1 mg to 100 mg doses of empagliflozin 
      had a good safety and tolerability profile in healthy Japanese male subjects. 
      Exposure to empagliflozin was dose proportional. The amount and rate of urinary 
      glucose excretion were higher with empagliflozin than with the placebo, and 
      increased with empagliflozin dose.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and 
      pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin, a potent and highly selective sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). METHODS: A total of 48 patients with T2DM were randomized to receive one 
      of four doses of empagliflozin (2.5, 10, 25, or 100 mg qd) or placebo over 
      8 days. In every dose group, nine patients received active drug and three 
      received placebo. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. 
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were measured as secondary 
      endpoints. RESULTS: Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, reaching peak levels 
      1.5-3.0 h after dosing and showed a biphasic decline. The mean terminal 
      elimination half-life ranged from 10 to 19 h. Increases in exposure (area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] and maximum concentration of analyte in 
      plasma [C max]) were approximately proportional with dose. Empagliflozin 
      increased the rate and total amount of glucose excreted in urine compared to 
      placebo. After administration of a single dose of empagliflozin, cumulative 
      amounts of glucose excreted in urine over 24 h ranged from 46.3 to 89.8 g, 
      compared with 5.84 g with placebo. Similar results were seen after multiple 
      doses. Fasting plasma glucose levels decreased by 17.2-25.8% with empagliflozin 
      and by 12.7% with placebo. The frequency of adverse events was 33.3-66.7% with 
      empagliflozin and 41.7% with placebo. There were no changes in urine volume or 
      micturition frequency under the controlled study conditions. CONCLUSION: Overall, 
      pharmacokinetic assessments demonstrated a dose-proportional increase in drug 
      exposure and support once-daily dosing. Elevated urinary glucose excretion was 
      observed with all doses. Multiple once-daily oral doses of empagliflozin 
      (2.5-100 mg) reduced plasma glucose and were well tolerated in patients with 
      T2DM. EudraCT (2007-000654-32).

TI  - Effect of empagliflozin on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol 
      and levonorgestrel in healthy female volunteers.
PG  - 351-7
LID - 10.1007/s40261-013-0068-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is a potent, selective inhibitor of sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 in development for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Oral contraceptives may be co-administered with antidiabetic agents 
      over long periods of time, therefore potential drug-drug interactions between 
      oral contraceptives and antidiabetic drugs should be investigated. OBJECTIVE: The 
      effect of multiple oral doses of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily (qd) on the 
      steady-state pharmacokinetics of the combined oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol 
      (EE) 30 μg/levonorgestrel (LNG) 150 μg qd was investigated. STUDY DESIGN: This 
      was a phase I, open-label, two-period, fixed sequence study. SETTING: The study 
      was performed at the Human Pharmacology Centre/Department of Translational 
      Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim, Biberach, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen healthy 
      premenopausal women participated in the study. INTERVENTION: There was a 
      mandatory run-in period in which participants received EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg qd for 
      21-48 days followed by a treatment-free interval of 7 days. Participants then 
      received EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg qd for 14 days (reference; period 1), followed by EE 
      30 μg/LNG 150 μg qd plus empagliflozin 25 mg qd for 7 days (test; period 2). MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG at steady state based on the 
      primary endpoints of area under the steady-state plasma concentration-time curve 
      during a dosage interval τ (AUC(τ,ss)) and maximum steady-state plasma 
      concentration during a dosage interval (C (max,ss)) were the main outcome 
      measures. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG were not affected by 
      co-administration with empagliflozin. Geometric mean ratios (90 % CI) of 
      AUC(τ,ss) and C (max,ss) for EE were 102.82 % (97.58, 108.35) and 99.22 % (93.40, 
      105.39), respectively. For LNG, these values were 101.94 % (98.54, 105.47) and 
      105.81 % (99.47, 112.55), respectively. The 90 % CIs were within the standard 
      bioequivalence boundaries of 80-125 %. There were no relevant changes in the time 
      to reach peak levels (t (max,ss)) or terminal elimination half-life (t (½,ss)) of 
      EE and LNG between test and reference treatments. Ten women in each treatment had 
      at least one adverse event (AE). Severe AEs were reported by three women in the 
      reference period and one woman in the test period. There were no serious AEs or 
      premature discontinuations. CONCLUSION: The combination of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg 
      and empagliflozin 25 mg was well tolerated. Based on standard bioequivalence 
      criteria, empagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG, 
      indicating that no dose adjustment of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg is required when 
      empagliflozin is co-administered.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes following oral 
      administration of 10, 25 or 100 mg doses once daily over 28 days. METHODS: A 
      total of 78 patients were assigned to empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 16), 25 mg 
      (n = 16) or 100 mg (n = 30) or placebo (n = 16) for 28 days. Assessments included 
      adverse events (AEs) and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints. RESULTS: 
      Empagliflozin exposure increased dose-proportionally over the dose range 10-100 
      mg and showed linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. Urinary glucose 
      excretion (UGE) increased from baseline to day 1 by 74, 90 and 81 g with 
      empagliflozin 10, 25 and 100 mg, respectively. The increases in UGE were 
      maintained over 28 days with multiple dosing. Virtually no change in UGE was 
      observed in the placebo group. Significant reductions from baseline in mean daily 
      plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose were observed with empagliflozin 
      compared with placebo. The incidence of AEs was similar in the empagliflozin and 
      placebo groups (50.0, 56.3 and 66.7% with empagliflozin rising doses and 62.5% 
      with placebo). The most frequently reported AEs were pollakiuria (10.3%), 
      nasopharyngitis (9.0%), constipation (9.0%) and headache (7.7%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Oral administration of empagliflozin at doses of 10, 25 or 100 mg once daily over 
      28 days resulted in significant increases in UGE and reductions in blood glucose 
      compared with placebo, and were well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic properties of empagliflozin 5 mg twice daily (BID) and 10 mg 
      once daily (QD) in healthy subjects. METHODS: In an open-label, 2-way crossover 
      study, subjects (n = 16) received empagliflozin 5 mg BID for 5 days and 
      empagliflozin 10 mg QD for 5 days in a randomized order, with a washout period of 
      ≥6 days between each treatment. The primary objective was the comparison of the 
      overall exposure during a 24-hour period at steady state (AUC0-24,ss) for 
      empagliflozin, based on standard bioequivalence criteria, with BID and QD dose 
      regimens. FINDINGS: The study population comprised 7 (43.8%) men and 9 (56.3%) 
      women with a baseline median age of 38.0 years (range, 23-47 years) and a median 
      body mass index of 23.3 kg/m(2) (range, 19.8-27.8 kg/m(2)). Based on standard 
      bioequivalence criteria, there was no difference in the overall exposure of 
      empagliflozin between BID and QD dose regimens (geometric mean ratio of 
      AUC0-24,ss for empagliflozin 5 mg BID compared with empagliflozin 10 mg QD = 
      99.36%; 90% CI, 94.29-104.71). For empagliflozin 10 mg QD, mean (%CV) AUC during 
      the dosing interval was 1900 nmol · h/L (20.6%), mean (%CV) Cmax,ss was 330 
      nmol/L (25.3%), and median (range) Tmax,ss was 1.0 hour (0.7-2.0 hours). For 
      empagliflozin 5 mg BID, mean (%CV) AUC during the dosing interval was 1010 nmol · 
      h/L (15.1%) and 867 nmol · h/L (18.6%) after the morning and evening dose, 
      respectively, mean (%CV) Cmax,ss was 193 nmol/L (16.5%) and 120 nmol/L (21.0%), 
      respectively, and median Tmax,ss was 1.0 hour (range, 0.7-2.0 hours) and 2.0 
      hours (range, 1.0-4.0 hours), respectively. The mean (%CV) cumulative amount of 
      glucose excreted in urine during 24 hours was 52.1 g (32.1%) with empagliflozin 5 
      mg BID and 43.9 g (30.3%) with empagliflozin 10 mg QD. Adverse events were 
      reported in six subjects (37.5%) receiving empagliflozin 5 mg BID and four 
      (25.0%) receiving empagliflozin 10 mg QD. Headache was the most frequent AE. No 
      severe, serious, or drug-related AEs were reported. IMPLICATIONS: There were no 
      clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties 
      between BID and QD dose regimens of empagliflozin in healthy subjects. Both dose 
      regimens were well tolerated. EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT) number:

PG  - 1487-1494
LID - 10.1080/03639045.2020.1810263 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the bioequivalence of a 
      generic empagliflozin tablet versus a brand-named empagliflozin tablet 
      (Jardiance(®)) and evaluate the food effects on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      empagliflozin in healthy Chinese subjects. METHODS: Forty-eight healthy 
      volunteers were included in this randomized, open-label, crossover, two-period 
      study (fasting: n = 24, fed: n = 24). A single dose of 25-mg generic (or test) or 
      brand-named (or reference) empagliflozin was administered to each subject in a 
      randomized sequence. Blood samples were collected at the baseline and during the 
      72 h post-dose, and plasma empagliflozin concentrations were determined by high 
      performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed with non-compartmental methods. Safety 
      was monitored. RESULTS: The major PK parameters including C (max), AUC(0-) (t) , 
      and AUC(0-∞) were similar between the generic and brand-named tablets under 
      fasting and fed conditions (all p > .05). The 90% confidence intervals of the 
      test/reference ratios of log-transformed C (max), AUC(0-) (t) , and AUC(0-∞) were 
      94.90-106.70%, 100.62-106.99%, and 100.64-106.85%, respectively, under fasting 
      condition, and 94.21-104.91%, 97.31-101.79%, and 97.32-101.83%, respectively, 
      under fed condition. High-fat food did not affect C (max), AUC(0-) (t) , 
      AUC(0-∞), or T (max) of empagliflozin (all p > .05). There was no serious adverse 
      event during the study period. CONCLUSION: The generic formulation of 
      empagliflozin tablet is bioequivalent to the brand-named product in healthy 
      Chinese volunteers, and well tolerated. High-fat food had no effects on the PK of 
      empagliflozin in healthy Chinese volunteers.

LID - 10.1080/00325481.2020.1750228 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy can improve outcomes in type 2 
      diabetes (T2D). We evaluated the bioequivalence of 2 doses of an FDC of 
      extended-release metformin (metformin XR), empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter 2 inhibitor, and linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, 
      versus corresponding free tablet combinations. METHODS: Two randomized, 
      open-label, two-way crossover studies in healthy adults compared: 2 FDC tablets 
      of empagliflozin 5 mg/linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin XR 1000 mg (Study 1; N = 30), 
      1 FDC tablet of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg/metformin XR 1000 mg (Study 
      2; N = 30) versus corresponding dose of free combinations. Subjects received 
      study medication under fed conditions; washout was ≥35 days between treatments. 
      Primary endpoints: area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 
      0 to last quantifiable data point for empagliflozin and metformin; AUC from time 
      0 to 72 hours for linagliptin, and peak plasma concentration (C(max)) for 
      empagliflozin, linagliptin, and metformin. Bioequivalence was defined as adjusted 
      geometric mean ratios (FDC: free combination) and two-sided 90% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) of AUC and C(max) for each component within 80.00-125.00%. 
      RESULTS: Study 1: 27/29 and 28/30 treated participants were included in the 
      pharmacokinetic analysis for the FDC and free combination periods, respectively. 
      Study 2: 29/29 treated participants were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis 
      for both periods. The adjusted geometric mean ratios of FDCs to their respective 
      free tablet combinations and two-sided 90% CIs were all within the predefined 
      range. The shapes of the mean plasma concentration-time profile of empagliflozin, 
      linagliptin, and metformin XR were similar for subjects in the FDC and free 
      combination groups in both studies. No serious adverse events were reported. 
      CONCLUSION: The evaluated doses of empagliflozin/linagliptin/metformin XR FDC 
      tablets were bioequivalent to the corresponding free combinations. Based on these 
      two bioequivalence studies and existing phase 3 data, the FDA has recently 
      approved this triple FDC to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D.

TI  - Effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of renal impairment 
      on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles of empagliflozin, a 
      sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in Japanese patients with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In an open-label, parallel-group study, 32 
      Japanese patients with T2DM and different degrees of renal function (n = 8 per 
      renal function category: normal renal function, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate [eGFR; Japanese equation] ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m(2); mild renal impairment, eGFR 
      of 60-<90 mL/min/1.73 m(2); moderate renal impairment, eGFR of 30-<60 mL/min/1.73 
      m(2); and severe renal impairment, eGFR of 15-<30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) received a 
      single 25 mg dose of empagliflozin. FINDINGS: Empagliflozin exposure increased 
      with increasing renal impairment. Maximum empagliflozin plasma concentrations 
      were similar among all renal function groups. Adjusted geometric mean ratios for 
      extent of exposure (AUC0-∞) to empagliflozin versus normal renal function were 
      128.8% (95% CI, 106.0-156.6%), 143.8% (95% CI, 118.3-174.8%), and 152.3% (95% CI, 
      125.3-185.2%) for patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, 
      respectively. Decreases in renal clearance of empagliflozin correlated with eGFR. 
      Urinary glucose excretion decreased with increasing renal impairment and 
      correlated with eGFR (adjusted mean [SE] change from baseline: 75.0 [4.84] g, 
      62.6 [5.75] g, 57.9 [4.86] g, and 23.7 [5.24] g for patients with normal renal 
      function and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively). Only 2 
      patients (6%) had adverse events; both were mild. IMPLICATIONS: Pharmacokinetic 
      data suggest that no dose adjustment of empagliflozin is necessary in Japanese 
      patients with T2DM and renal impairment because increases in exposure were 
      <2-fold. Urinary glucose excretion decreased with increasing renal impairment.

TI  - Effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and assessment of dose proportionality in 
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 873-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Empagliflozin is an orally available, potent and highly selective 
      inhibitor of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). This study was 
      undertaken to investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of 25 mg 
      empagliflozin and to assess dose proportionality between 10 mg and 25 mg 
      empagliflozin under fasted conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, 
      3-way, cross-over study, 18 healthy volunteers received 3 single doses of 
      empagliflozin in a randomized sequence (25 mg empagliflozin under fasted 
      conditions, 25 mg empagliflozin after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast and 10 
      mg empagliflozin under fasted conditions), each separated by a washout period of 
      at least 7 days. Serial plasma samples were collected at selected time points 
      over a period of 72 hours. RESULTS: Administration with food had no clinically 
      relevant effect on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of 
      empagliflozin (geometric mean ratio (GMR): 84.04, 90% confidence interval (CI): 
      80.86 - 87.34). The decrease observed in the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) 
      of empagliflozin (GMR: 63.22, 90% CI: 56.74 - 70.44) when administered with food 
      was not considered clinically meaningful. The increases in AUC0-∞ and Cmax for 10 
      mg vs. 25 mg empagliflozin administered under fasting conditions were roughly 
      dose-proportional, as demonstrated by the slope β of the regression lines being 
      slightly less than 1 (slope β for AUC0-∞: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90 - 0.97; slope β for 
      Cmax: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80 - 1.01). Empagliflozin was well tolerated under fed and 
      fasting conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The results support administration of 
      empagliflozin tablets independently of food. Increases in empagliflozin exposure 
      under fasting conditions were roughly dose-proportional between 10 mg and 25 mg 
      empagliflozin.

TI  - Assessing pharmacokinetic interactions between the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 
      inhibitor empagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide or torasemide in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, open-label, crossover study.

AB  - PURPOSE: Empagliflozin is a potent, selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 
      inhibitor approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thiazide or 
      loop diuretics are commonly prescribed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      This study investigated potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between 
      empagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or torasemide (TOR). METHODS: This 
      was an open-label, crossover study. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were 
      randomized to receive empagliflozin 25 mg once daily for 5 days and either HCTZ 
      25 mg once daily for 4 days followed by HCTZ 25 mg once daily plus empagliflozin 
      25 mg once daily for 5 days or TOR 5 mg once daily for 4 days followed by TOR 5 
      mg once daily plus empagliflozin once daily for 5 days in 1 of 4 sequences, with 
      at least a 7-day washout period between treatments. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      empagliflozin, HCTZ, and TOR were assessed and standard bioequivalence criteria 
      (80%-125%) were applied. Tolerability assessments included the frequency of 
      adverse events and an investigator assessment of global tolerability. FINDINGS: 
      Mean (SD) age of the 22 patients treated was 54.0 (8.1) years and body mass index 
      was 27.1 (3.7) kg/m(2). Coadministration of empagliflozin with HCTZ or TOR had no 
      effect on exposure to empagliflozin, HCTZ, or TOR. Geometric mean ratios (90% 
      CIs) for empagliflozin AUC over a uniform dosing interval and Cmax at steady 
      state were 107.1% (90% CI, 97.1-118.1) and 102.8% (90% CI, 88.6-119.3), 
      respectively, when coadministered with HCTZ versus administration alone, and 
      107.8% (90% CI, 100.1-116.1) and 107.5% (90% CI, 97.9-118.0), respectively, when 
      coadministered with TOR versus administration alone. For HCTZ, the geometric mean 
      ratios for AUC over a uniform dosing interval and Cmax at steady state were 96.3% 
      (90% CI, 89.1-104.0) and 101.8% (90% CI, 88.6-116.9), respectively, and for TOR 
      were 101.4% (90% CI, 99.1-103.9) and 104.4% (90% CI, 93.8-116.3), respectively, 
      for combined treatment versus administration alone. The pharmacokinetic profiles 
      of empagliflozin, HCTZ, and TOR were similar after administration alone and in 
      combination. Global tolerability was good for all patients after each treatment, 
      and no severe or serious adverse events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: No 
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was observed between empagliflozin and HCTZ 
      or TOR. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01276288.

LID - 10.1111/dme.13629 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of a single dose 
      of empagliflozin in young people with Type 2 diabetes to identify the appropriate 
      doses for further paediatric development. METHODS: We conducted a single-dose, 
      open-label, randomized, parallel-group study with empagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg and 
      25 mg in young people with Type 2 diabetes aged 10-17 years. RESULTS: Of 39 
      participants screened, 27 were randomized and completed the study; their mean (± 
      sd) age was 14.1±2.0 years and body weight was 96.7±23.5 kg. Compared with 
      similar studies in adults with Type 2 diabetes, the maximum observed plasma 
      concentrations were slightly lower with the 10-mg and 25-mg doses, and the area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve was slightly lower with the 10-mg but 
      slightly higher with the 25-mg dose. The adjusted mean increases in urinary 
      glucose excretion were 53 g/24 h (95% CI 32,74), 73 g/24 h (95% CI 52,94) and 87 
      g/24 h (95% CI 68,107), and the adjusted mean decreases in fasting plasma glucose 
      were 0.9 mmol/l (95% CI -1.6,-0.1), 0.9 mmol/l (95% CI -1.7,-0.2) and 1.1 mmol/l 
      (95% CI -1.8,-0.5) for the 5- 10- and 25-mg doses, respectively. There were no 
      serious adverse events and one investigator-reported drug-related event 
      (dehydration). CONCLUSIONS: After a single oral dose of empagliflozin, adults and 
      young people with Type 2 diabetes had similar exposure-response relationships 
      after adjusting for significant covariates. These data support testing 10-mg 
      and/or 25-mg doses of empagliflozin in an upcoming paediatric phase III Type 2 
      diabetes trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no.: NCT02121483).

AB  - Data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple oral dose studies of 
      empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; N = 974; 1-100 mg 
      q.d.; ≤12 weeks) were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for 
      empagliflozin. The model consisted of two-compartmental disposition, lagged 
      first-order absorption and first-order elimination, and incorporated appropriate 
      covariates. Population estimates (interindividual variance, CV%) of oral apparent 
      clearance, central and peripheral volumes of distribution, and 
      inter-compartmental clearance were 9.87 L/h (26.9%), 3.02 L, 60.4 L (30.8%), and 
      5.16 L/h, respectively. An imposed allometric weight effect was the most 
      influential PK covariate effect, with a maximum effect on exposure of ±30%, using 
      2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of observed weights, relative to the median observed 
      weight. Sex and race did not lend additional description to PK variability beyond 
      allometric weight effects, other than ∼25% greater oral absorption rate constant 
      for Asian patients. Age, total protein, and smoking/alcohol history did not 
      affect PK parameters. Predictive check plots were consistent with observed data, 
      implying an adequate description of empagliflozin PKs following multiple dosing 
      in patients with T2DM. The lack of marked covariate effects, including weight, 
      suggests that no exposure-based dose adjustments were required within the study 
      population and dose range.

PG  - 118-23
LID - 10.1111/dom.12183 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This open-label, parallel-group study investigated the effect of various 
      degrees of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of 
      the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin. METHODS: Thirty-six 
      subjects [8 each with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
      classification), and 12 matched controls with normal hepatic function] received a 
      single 50 mg dose of empagliflozin. RESULTS: Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed. 
      After reaching peak levels, plasma drug concentrations declined in a biphasic 
      fashion. Compared with subjects with normal hepatic function, geometric mean 
      ratios (90% confidence interval) of AUC(0-∞) and C(max) were 123.15% 
      (98.89-153.36) and 103.81% (82.29-130.95), respectively, in patients with mild 
      hepatic impairment, 146.97% (118.02-183.02) and 123.31% (97.74-155.55), 
      respectively, in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, and 174.70% 
      (140.29-217.55) and 148.41% (117.65-187.23), respectively, in patients with 
      severe hepatic impairment. Adverse events, all mild or moderate in intensity, 
      were reported in three subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, two subjects 
      with severe hepatic impairment and six subjects with normal hepatic function. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin was well tolerated in subjects with hepatic 
      impairment. Increases in empagliflozin exposure were less than twofold in 
      patients with hepatic impairment; therefore no dose adjustment of empagliflozin 
      is required in patients with hepatic impairment.

TI  - No Relevant Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Between the Sodium-Glucose 
      Co-Transporter-2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin and Lobeglitazone, a Peroxisome

AB  - PURPOSE: Combination therapy with insulin-independent sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitors and thiazolidinedione drugs, such as lobeglitazone, 
      has been reported to elicit potential additive efficacy in glycemic control in 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study was conducted to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and 
      lobeglitazone in healthy subjects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A randomized, 
      open-label, multiple-dose study was conducted in 30 healthy subjects using a 
      three-treatment, six-sequence, three-way crossover design. Subjects received one 
      of the following treatments once daily for 5 days in each period: 25 mg 
      empagliflozin, 0.5 mg lobeglitazone sulfate, or a combination. Serial blood 
      sampling before every dose and up to 24 h after the last dose was performed 
      during each treatment period. The PK parameters were estimated using 
      noncompartmental methods with the plasma empagliflozin and lobeglitazone 
      concentrations. The absence of a PK interaction was construed as the 90% 
      confidence interval (90% CI) of maximum concentration at steady state (C(max,ss)) 
      and area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC(tau)) 
      for combination therapy-to-monotherapy ratios within the limits of 0.80-1.25. 
      RESULTS: The steady-state plasma empagliflozin and lobeglitazone 
      concentration-time profiles of combination therapy and monotherapy were 
      comparable in the 25 subjects who completed the study. Coadministration of 
      empagliflozin with lobeglitazone did not affect empagliflozin PK (with 90% CIs of 
      0.956-1.150 and 0.945-1.133 for C(max,ss) and AUC(tau), respectively). Likewise, 
      empagliflozin did not affect lobeglitazone C(max,ss) or AUC(tau) (with 90% CIs of 
      0.869-0.995 and 0.851-1.018, respectively). All treatment groups tolerated mild 
      adverse events well. CONCLUSION: The lack of PK interactions between 
      lobeglitazone and empagliflozin in combination therapy, along with their good 
      tolerability, indicates that the two drugs can be coadministered without dose 
      adjustment. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02854748, Registered on August 7, 2016.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of sodium 
      glucose cotransporter 2, inhibition of which reduces renal glucose reabsorption 
      and results in increased urinary glucose excretion. Linagliptin is an oral 
      inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada. Due to their complementary modes 
      of action, there is a good rationale to combine empagliflozin with linagliptin to 
      improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin and 
      linagliptin after coadministration in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was an 
      open-label, randomized, multiple-dose, crossover study with 3 treatments in 2 
      treatment sequences. Sixteen healthy male subjects received treatment A 
      (empagliflozin 50 mg once daily [QD] for 5 days), treatment B (empagliflozin 50 
      mg QD and linagliptin 5 mg QD for 7 days), and treatment C (linagliptin 5 mg QD 
      for 7 days) in sequence AB then C, or sequence C then AB. RESULTS: Sixteen 
      healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 50 years with a body mass index of 18.5 
      to 29.9 kg/m(2) were included in the study. Linagliptin total exposure (AUC over 
      a uniform dosing interval τ at steady state geometric mean ratio [GMR], 1.03 [90% 
      CI, 0.96-1.11]) and peak exposure (C(max) at steady state GMR, 1.01 [90% CI, 
      0.87-1.19) exposure was unaffected by coadministration of empagliflozin. 
      Empagliflozin total exposure (AUC over a uniform dosing interval τ at steady 
      state GMR, 1.02 [90% CI, 0.97-1.07]) was unaffected by coadministration of 
      linagliptin. There was a reduction in empagliflozin peak exposure (C(max) at 
      steady state GMR, 0.88 [90% CI, 0.79-0.99]) when linagliptin was coadministered 
      that was not considered clinically meaningful. No adverse events were reported 
      during the coadministration period. No hypoglycemia was reported. Empagliflozin 
      and linagliptin were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: These data support the 
      coadministration of empagliflozin and linagliptin without dose adjustments.

TI  - The effect of morning versus evening administration of empagliflozin on its 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics characteristics in healthy adults: a 
      two-way crossover, non-randomised trial.
PG  - 321

LID - 321
AB  - Background: Empagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor approved for use in patients with 
      diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) with or without other cardiovascular disease. 
      Empagliflozin is taken once daily without rationale on the optimal timing for 
      administration. This study aimed to determine the chronopharmacological effects 
      of morning vs evening administration of empagliflozin (10 mg) in healthy Egyptian 
      adults, by investigating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters of 
      empagliflozin depending on the intake time. Methods: An open label, sequential, 
      two-way crossover trial comprised of two periods with a washout period of 7 days. 
      All participants received a single oral dose of empagliflozin (JARDIANCE ®; 10 mg 
      film coated tablet) in the evening, and after a seven-day washout period, the 
      morning. Pharmacokinetics parameters (primary endpoints: t (max) (h), C (max) 
      (ng/ml), AUC (0-t) (ng.h/ml); secondary endpoints: AUC (0 to ∞)(ng.h/ml)) were 
      assessed. Method validation was done prior to injection in LC/MS/MS and samples 
      were processed by Liquid-Liquid extraction. The pharmacodynamic profile (UGE 
      (0-24)) was determined after method validation (glucose hexokinase method). 
      Results: T (max) increased by 35% in the evening phase compared to the morning 
      phase, while C (max) decreased by -6.5% in the evening dose compared to the 
      morning dose. Additionally, AUC (0 to ∞) increased in the evening phase by 8.25% 
      compared to the morning phase. The mean cumulative amount of glucose excreted 
      (UGE ( (0-24))) increased by 43% in the evening dose compared to the morning dose 
      Conclusion: Despite the difference in pharmacokinetics parameters between evening 
      and morning doses, C (max), AUC (0-t), AUC (0-∞), didn't differ on the 
      bioequivalence level. In addition, as UGE ( (0-24)) didn't statistically differ, 
      thus, we can conclude that there is no statistical significance between the 
      morning and evening doses. Trial registration: Clinal Trials.gov, ID: NCT03895229 
      (registered on 29 (th) March 2019).

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Empagliflozin in Healthy Egyptian Volunteers Using 
      LC-MS/MS and Comparison with Other Ethnic Populations.
PG  - 2583

AB  - The present study considered the pharmacokinetic evaluation of empagliflozin 
      after administration to Egyptian volunteers, and the results were compared with 
      other ethnic populations. The FDA recognizes that standard methods of defining 
      racial subgroups are necessary to compare results across pharmacokinetic studies 
      and to assess potential subgroup differences. The design of the study was as an 
      open labeled, randomized, one treatment, one period, single dose pharmacokinetic 
      study. The main pharmacokinetic parameters estimated were C(max), T(max), t(1/2), 
      elimination rate constant, AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-inf). The insignificant difference 
      in pharmacokinetic parameters between Egyptians and white German subjects 
      suggests that no dose adjustment should be considered with administration of 
      25 mg empagliflozin to Egyptian population. A new LC-MS/MS method was developed 
      and validated, allowing sensitive estimation of empagliflozin (25-600 ng mL(-1)) 
      in human plasma using dapagliflozin as an internal standard (IS). The method was 
      applied successfully on the underlying pharmacokinetic study with enhanced sample 
      preparation that involved liquid-liquid extraction. Multiple Reaction Monitoring 
      (MRM) of the transition pairs of m/z 449.01 to 371.21 for empagliflozin and m/z 
      407.00 to 328.81 for dapagliflozin (IS) was employed utilizing negative mode 
      Electro Spray Ionization (ESI). The validated LC-MS/MS method is suitable for 
      further toxicodynamic and bioequivalence studies.

      inhibitor, and metformin following co-administration in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 132-40
LID - 10.5414/CP201794 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This open-label study investigated potential drug-drug interactions 
      between empagliflozin and metformin. METHODS: 16 healthy men received treatment A 
      (empagliflozin 50 mg q.d. for 5 days), treatment B (empagliflozin 50 mg q.d. for 
      4 days with metformin 1,000 mg b.i.d. for 3 days and 1,000 mg q.d. on Day 4) and 
      treatment C (metformin 1,000 mg b.i.d. for 3 days and 1,000 mg q.d .on Day 4) in 
      the sequence AB then C, or C then AB. RESULTS: Metformin had no clinically 
      relevant effect on the area under the steady state plasma concentration-time 
      curve (AUC(τ,ss) geometric mean ratio (GMR): 96.9; 90% CI: 92.3 - 101.7) or the 
      maximum plasma concentration at steady state (C(max,ss) GMR: 100.5; 90% CI: 88.8 
      - 113.7) of empagliflozin. Similarly, empagliflozin had no clinically relevant 
      effect on AUC(τ,ss) (GMR: 100.7; 90% CI: 95.9 - 105.6) or C(max,ss) (GMR: 103.6; 
      90% CI: 96.5 - 111.2) of metformin. The renal clearance of empagliflozin and 
      metformin were unaffected by co-administration. Both drugs were well tolerated 
      alone and in combination and did not cause hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      support co-administration of empagliflozin and metformin without dose adjustment.

TI  - Relative bioavailability of an empagliflozin 25-mg/linagliptin 5-mg fixed-dose 
      combination tablet .
PG  - 355-367
LID - 10.5414/CP202929 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This relative bioavailability study compared a fixed-dose combination 
      (FDC) tablet of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg with the corresponding 
      individual components. In addition, the effect of food on the bioavailability of 
      the FDC was studied, and the standard-dissolving formulation FDC was compared 
      with a slow-dissolving side batch. METHODS: An open-label, randomized, crossover 
      study design was used (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01189201). Healthy 
      volunteers (n = 42) each received three single-dose treatments: FDC standard 
      dissolution, individual tablets, and either FDC standard dissolution with food or 
      FDC slow dissolution. Primary endpoints for relative bioavailability comparisons 
      were area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) over time 0 to the last 
      time point with the plasma concentration above the quantification limit 
      (AUC(0-tz)) for empagliflozin, AUC from 0 to 72 hours (AUC(0-72)) for 
      linagliptin, and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) for both drugs. RESULTS: 
      In all three comparisons, the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of AUCs 
      were within the standard acceptance range (80 - 125%) for bioequivalence. 
      Empagliflozin and linagliptin both showed reductions in C(max) after food 
      compared with the fasted state, although overall exposure remained similar. The 
      empagliflozin/linagliptin combinations were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study shows that the FDC of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg can be regarded 
      as bioequivalent to the individual tablets. Administering the tablet after food 
      or a tablet with a slow-dissolution profile did not have a clinically-relevant 
      impact on the bioavailability of empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC tablets. .

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety and 
      tolerability of empagliflozin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 4-week, multiple dose, randomized, parallel-group, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients (n = 100) were randomized to 
      receive 1, 5, 10 or 25 mg of empagliflozin, or placebo once daily. Key end-points 
      were urinary glucose excretion (UGE), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 
      eight-point glucose profile. RESULTS: Data are presented for 1, 5, 10, 25 mg of 
      empagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Adjusted mean changes from 
      baseline to day 27 in UGE were 40.8, 77.1, 80.9, 93.0 and -2.1 g (P < 0.0001 for 
      all empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day 
      28 in FPG were -1.56, -1.96, -2.31, -2.37 and -0.86 mmol/L (P < 0.01 for all 
      empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day 27 
      in eight-point glucose profile were -1.96, -2.21, -2.42, -2.54 and -0.97 mmol/L 
      (P < 0.01 for all empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Empagliflozin reached peak 
      plasma concentration 1.5-2 h after dosing. Mean steady state terminal elimination 
      half-lives ranged from 13.2 to 18.0 h. Of 100 patients, 25 experienced an adverse 
      event, occurring more frequently for empagliflozin (29.1%) than placebo (9.5%); 
      frequency was not dose related. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus, empagliflozin at doses up to 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks was 
      well tolerated and resulted in significant improvements in glycemic control 
      compared with placebo. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no. 
      NCT00885118).

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose 
      co-transporter 2 inhibitor.
PG  - 213-225
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0126-x [doi]
AB  - Empagliflozin is an orally active, potent and selective inhibitor of sodium 
      glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), currently in clinical development to improve 
      glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). SGLT2 
      inhibitors, including empagliflozin, are the first pharmacological class of 
      antidiabetes agents to target the kidney in order to remove excess glucose from 
      the body and, thus, offer new options for T2DM management. SGLT2 inhibitors exert 
      their effects independently of insulin. Following single and multiple oral doses 
      (0.5-800 mg), empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed and reached peak plasma 
      concentrations after approximately 1.33-3.0 h, before showing a biphasic decline. 
      The mean terminal half-life ranged from 5.6 to 13.1 h in single rising-dose 
      studies, and from 10.3 to 18.8 h in multiple-dose studies. Following multiple 
      oral doses, increases in exposure were dose-proportional and trough 
      concentrations remained constant after day 6, indicating a steady state had been 
      reached. Oral clearance at steady state was similar to corresponding single-dose 
      values, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. No clinically 
      relevant alterations in pharmacokinetics were observed in mild to severe hepatic 
      impairment, or in mild to severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease. 
      Clinical studies did not reveal any relevant drug-drug interactions with several 
      other drugs commonly prescribed to patients with T2DM, including warfarin. 
      Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) rates were higher with empagliflozin versus 
      placebo and increased with dose, but no relevant impact on 24-h urine volume was 
      observed. Increased UGE resulted in proportional reductions in fasting plasma 
      glucose and mean daily glucose concentrations.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of fixed-dose combinations of empagliflozin/metformin compared 
      with individual tablets in healthy subjects.
PG  - 282-92
LID - 10.5414/CP202425 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacokinetics of fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
      tablets of empagliflozin/metformin with individual tablets taken together. 
      METHODS: In 3 randomized, open-label studies, healthy subjects received a single 
      FDC tablet of empagliflozin/metformin in 1 of 6 dose combinations (empagliflozin 
      12.5 mg or 5 mg; metformin 500 mg, 850 mg, or 1,000 mg) in 1 period and the 
      individual tablets taken together under fed conditions in another period. 
      Empagliflozin 12.5 mg/metformin 1,000 mg FDC and individual tablets were also 
      given under fasted conditions. RESULTS: Adjusted geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of 
      empagliflozin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-∞)) for the 
      FDCs vs. individual tablets ranged from 97.92 to 106.00%, and 90% CIs ranged from 
      93.53 to 109.39%. Adjusted GMRs of empagliflozin maximum plasma concentrations 
      (C(max)) for the FDCs vs. individual tablets ranged from 100.97 to 106.52%, and 
      90% CIs ranged from 95.86 to 118.35%. Adjusted GMRs of metformin AUC(0-∞) for the 
      FDCs vs. individual tablets ranged from 96.25 to 101.61%, and 90% CIs ranged from 
      88.54 to 106.62%. Adjusted GMRs of metformin C(max) for the FDCs vs. individual 
      tablets ranged from 93.83 to 102.95%, and 90% CIs ranged from 88.01 to 109.08%. 
      Bioequivalence was also established under fasted conditions for empagliflozin 
      12.5 mg/metformin 1,000 mg FDC vs. individual tablets taken together. All 
      treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin/metformin FDC tablets 
      were found to be bioequivalent to individual tablets taken together at all tested 
      dose strengths.

AB  - AIM: To investigate potential drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and 
      warfarin. METHODS: Healthy subjects (n = 18) received empagliflozin 25 mg qd for 
      5 days (treatment A), followed by empagliflozin 25 mg qd for 7 days (days 6-12) 
      with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin on day 6 (treatment B), and a single 25 mg 
      dose of warfarin alone (treatment C), in an open-label, crossover study. Subjects 
      received treatments in sequence AB_C or C_AB with a washout period of ≥14 days 
      between AB and C or C and AB. RESULTS: Warfarin had no effect on empagliflozin 
      area under concentration-time curve or maximum plasma concentration at 
      steady-state (AUC(τ,ss) or C(max,ss)): geometric mean ratios (GMRs) (90% 
      confidence intervals [CI]) were 100.89% (96.86, 105.10) and 100.64% (89.79, 
      112.80), respectively. Empagliflozin had no effect on AUC from 0 h to infinity 
      (AUC(0-∞)) or C(max) for R- or S-warfarin (GMRs [90% CI] for AUC(0-∞): 98.49% 
      [95.29, 101.80] and 95.88% [93.40, 98.43], respectively; C(max): 97.89% [91.12, 
      105.15] and 98.88% [91.84, 106.47], respectively). Empagliflozin had no 
      clinically relevant effects on warfarin's anticoagulant activity (international 
      normalised ratio [INR]) (GMR [95% CI] for peak INR: 0.87 [0.73, 1.04]; area under 
      the effect-time curve from 0 to 168 h: 0.88 [0.79, 0.98]. No drug-related adverse 
      events were reported for empagliflozin after monotherapy or combined 
      administration. The combination of empagliflozin and warfarin was well tolerated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: No drug-drug interactions were observed between empagliflozin and 
      warfarin, indicating that empagliflozin and warfarin can be co-administered 
      without dosage adjustments of either drug.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic properties and tolerability of the oral once-daily sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin, given in single and multiple 10 and 25 
      mg doses in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In a 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, Chinese patients with 
      T2DM were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg 
      or placebo on day 1 and once daily on days 3 to 9. FINDINGS: A total of 24 
      patients were enrolled (14 men, 10 women; median age, 53.5 years; empagliflozin 
      10 mg, n = 9; empagliflozin 25 mg, n = 9; and placebo, n = 6). After both single- 
      and multiple-dose administration, empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg were rapidly 
      absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 1.5 hours (median), 
      with plasma levels declining biphasically. Empagliflozin exposure increased 
      roughly dose proportionally between 10 and 25 mg. Mean terminal elimination 
      half-life values at steady state were 13.9 and 12.1 hours with empagliflozin 10 
      and 25 mg, respectively. Mean (SD) changes from baseline in 24-hour urinary 
      glucose excretion (UGE) on day 1 were +87.7 (22.9) and +82.8 (18.8) g with 
      empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared with -1.0 (2.8) g with 
      placebo, and on day 9 were +95.8 (24.1), +82.6 (34.8) g with empagliflozin 10 and 
      25 mg, respectively, compared with -4.1 (6.4) g with placebo. Mean (SD) changes 
      from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) on day 2 were -18.7 (17.2) mg/dL 
      and -25.8 (19.6) mg/dL with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared 
      with -4.2 (15.2) mg/dL with placebo, and on day 9, were -25.6 (20.7) mg/dL and 
      -31.4 (26.9) mg/dL with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared to 
      -3.7 (7.5) mg/dL with placebo. On day 10, mean changes in weight were -1.1, -1.6, 
      and +0.5 kg with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo, respectively. Overall, 
      empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg had safety profiles similar to that of placebo. There 
      were no reports of hypoglycemia, urinary tract infections, or genital infections. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Results with single and multiple doses of empagliflozin 10 and 25 
      mg suggest linear pharmacokinetic properties in Chinese patients with T2DM, with 
      a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Empagliflozin treatment was 
      associated with increases in UGE and reductions in FPG compared with placebo.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, 
      and simvastatin following co-administration in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 973-80
LID - 10.5414/CP202117 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to investigate potential drugdrug 
      interactions between the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin 
      and simvastatin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, randomized crossover 
      trial, healthy volunteers (median (range) age 36.5 (20 - 50) years) received 3 
      single-dose treatments: 25 mg empagliflozin (n = 18), 40 mg simvastatin (n = 17), 
      and 25 mg empagliflozin with 40 mg simvastatin (n = 18). RESULTS: Based on 
      standard criteria, simvastatin had no effect on empagliflozin area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-∞), adjusted geometric mean ratio (GMR): 
      102.05; 90% CI: 98.90 - 105.29) or maximum plasma concentration (C(max), GMR: 
      109.49; 90% CI: 96.91 - 123.69). There were only minor deviations in simvastatin 
      AUC(0-∞) (GMR: 101.26; 90% CI: 80.06 - 128.07) and C(max) (GMR: 97.18; 90% CI: 
      76.30 - 123.77) when co-administered with empagliflozin. Empagliflozin had no 
      effect on AUC(0-∞) (GMR: 104.87; 90% CI: 90.09 - 122.07) or C(max) (GMR: 97.27; 
      90% CI: 84.90 - 111.44) of simvastatin acid, the active metabolite of 
      simvastatin. Adverse events (AEs) were reported for 6 subjects on empagliflozin, 
      4 on simvastatin, and 5 on co-administered treatment. No serious AEs or 
      investigator-defined drug-related AEs were reported. CONCLUSION: No relevant 
      drug-drug interaction was observed, and pharmacokinetic results suggest that no 
      dose adjustments for either drug are necessary when empagliflozin and simvastatin 
      are co-administered. Empagliflozin was well tolerated when administered alone or 
      in combination with simvastatin.

TI  - A validated LC-MS/MS method for the determination of canagliflozin, a 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, in a lower volume of rat 
      plasma: application to pharmacokinetic studies in rats.
PG  - 1549-55
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3720 [doi]
AB  - Canagliflozin is a novel, orally selective inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. In this study, a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantitative analysis of canagliflozin in 
      a lower volume of rat plasma (0.1 mL) was established and applied to a 
      pharmacokinetic study in rats. Following liquid-liquid extraction by tert-butyl 
      methyl ether, chromatographic separation of canagliflozin was performed on a 
      Quicksorb ODS (2.1 mm i.d. × 150 mm, 5 µm size) using acetonitrile-0.1% formic 
      acid (90:10, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The detection 
      was carried out using an API 3200 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer operating 
      in the positive electrospray ionization mode. Selected ion monitoring transitions 
      of m/z = 462.0 [M + NH4 ](+)  → 191.0 for canagliflozin and m/z = 451.2 
      [M + H](+)  → 71.0 for empagliflozin (internal standard) were obtained. The 
      validation of the method was investigated, and it was found to be of sufficient 
      specificity, accuracy and precision. Canagliflozin in rat plasma was stable under 
      the analytical conditions used. This validated method was successfully applied to 
      assess the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin in rats using 0.1 mL rat plasma.

AB  - Tofogliflozin is a novel selective inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) and has been developed for the treatment of patients 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the 
      quantitation of tofogliflozin in rat plasma was developed and validated. The 
      detection was performed using an API 3200 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer 
      with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in the positive electrospray ionization 
      mode. The SRM transitions were m/z=387.1 [M+H](+)→267.1 for tofogliflozin and 
      m/z=451.2 [M+H](+)→71.0 for empagliflozin (internal standard: I.S.). 
      Chromatographic separation was performed on a Quicksorb ODS (2.1mm i.d.×150mm, 
      5μm size) using isocratic elution with acetonitrile/10mM ammonium acetate (50:50, 
      v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2mL/min and the total run time was 
      4.0min. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for tofogliflozin was 0.5ng/mL 
      with sufficient specificity, accuracy, and precision. The validated method was 
      successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic studies of tofogliflozin in rats. 
      This assay method could be a valuable tool for future studies including 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of SGLT2 inhibitors.

AB  - A simple, economic, green, and sensitive bioanalytical method for empagliflozin 
      bioassay in rats' plasma was employed successfully owing to the empagliflozin 
      native fluorescence behavior. Enhanced liquid-liquid extraction, using diethyl 
      ether (DEE), was successfully employed for the improved extraction of 
      empagliflozin from rats' plasma based on its high value of logP as 1.8 that 
      boosted the drug migration from plasma to the organic layer. The relative 
      fluorescence intensity for empagliflozin was recorded at emission (299.4 nm) 
      after excitation at 226.5 nm. The method was validated with satisfactory results 
      for linearity (500-5000 ng/mL), trueness, precision, the matrix effect, and 
      extraction recovery. The matrix effect ranged between 15.63% and 23.10% for LQC 
      and HQC samples, respectively. Extraction recovery ranged between 54.61% and 
      62.54% for LQC and HQC samples, respectively. Bias values for the trueness ranged 
      between -10.62 and +14.95, while %RSD values for the precision ranged between 
      5.39% and 9.33%. The method was successfully applied to rats' plasma samples that 
      included six rats, and the drug concentration was determined in their plasma 
      after 1 hour (estimated Cmax based on literature) following oral administration 
      of empagliflozin with a concentration of 10 mg/Kg, p.o.. The developed 
      cost-effective spectrofluorimetric method in the present work will be of 
      beneficial use in further pharmacokinetic studies that include rats' plasma and 
      biological fluids. Moreover, with the suitable modifications, the described novel 
      extraction of empagliflozin could be adopted to human plasma samples and future 
      clinical studies. Moreover, development of new simple cost-effective methods is 
      necessary to give the researchers a set of "varieties" that they can use 
      according to the laboratory limitations, especially in the developing countries 
      in addition of being a greener method due to the lower consumption of toxic 
      solvents and lower waste production.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor, coadministered with sitagliptin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 889-99
LID - 10.1007/s12325-012-0055-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This randomized, open-label, crossover study investigated potential 
      drug-drug interactions between the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor empagliflozin and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor 
      sitagliptin. Empagliflozin is a potent and selective SGLT-2 inhibitor that lowers 
      blood glucose levels by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, leading to an 
      increase in urinary glucose excretion. Sitagliptin lowers blood glucose through 
      an insulin-dependent mechanism of action. METHODS: Sixteen healthy male 
      volunteers received three treatments (A, B, C) in one of two treatment sequences 
      (AB then C, or C then AB). In treatment AB, 50 mg empagliflozin was administered 
      once daily (q.d.) for 5 days (treatment A), immediately followed by 
      coadministration of 50 mg empagliflozin q.d. and 100 mg sitagliptin q.d. over 5 
      days (treatment B). In treatment C, 100 mg sitagliptin was administered q.d. for 
      5 days. A washout period of ≥7 days separated treatments AB and C. RESULTS: 
      Coadministration of sitagliptin with empagliflozin did not have a clinically 
      relevant effect on the area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in 
      plasma at steady state over a uniform dosing interval τ (AUC(τ,ss)) (geometric 
      mean ratio [GMR] 110.4; 90% confidence interval [CI] 103.9, 117.3) or maximum 
      measured concentration of the analyte in plasma at steady state over a uniform 
      dosing interval τ (C (max,ss)) (GMR 107.6; 90% CI 97.0, 119.4) of empagliflozin. 
      Coadministration of empagliflozin with sitagliptin did not have a clinically 
      meaningful effect on the AUC(τ,ss) (GMR 103.1; 90% CI 98.9, 107.3) or C (max,ss) 
      (GMR 108.5; 90% CI 100.7, 116.9) of sitagliptin. Empagliflozin and sitagliptin 
      were well tolerated when given alone or in combination. Five subjects (31.3%) 
      reported at least one adverse event (AE): three (18.8%) experienced an AE while 
      receiving empagliflozin monotherapy and three (18.8%) while receiving sitagliptin 
      monotherapy. No adverse events were reported during the coadministration period. 
      No AEs were regarded as drug-related by the investigator. CONCLUSION: These 
      results indicate that empagliflozin and sitagliptin can be coadministered without 
      dose adjustments.

AB  - 1. The absorption, biotransformation and excretion of empagliflozin, an SGLT2 
      inhibitor, were evaluated in eight healthy subjects following a single 50 mg oral 
      dose of empagliflozin containing ∼100 µCi [(14)C]-empagliflozin. 2. Radioactivity 
      was rapidly absorbed, with plasma levels peaking 1 h post-dose. Total exposure 
      was lower in blood versus plasma, consistent with moderate (28.6-36.8%) red blood 
      cell partitioning. Protein binding was 80.3-86.2%. 3. Most of the radioactive 
      dose was recovered in urine (54.4%) and faeces (41.1%). Unchanged empagliflozin 
      was the most abundant drug-related component in plasma, representing 75.5-77.4% 
      of plasma radioactivity and 79.6% plasma radioactivity AUC0-12 h. Unchanged 
      empagliflozin was the most abundant drug-related component in urine and faeces, 
      representing 43.5% (23.7% of dose) and 82.9% (34.1% of dose) of radioactivity in 
      urine and faeces, respectively. Six metabolites were identified in plasma: three 
      glucuronide conjugates representing 4.7-7.1% of AUC0-12 h and three less abundant 
      metabolites (<0.2-1.9% AUC0-12 h). The most abundant metabolites in urine were 
      two glucuronide conjugates (7.8-13.2% of dose) and in faeces was a 
      tetrahydrofuran ring-opened carboxylic acid metabolite (1.9% of dose). 4. To 
      conclude, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed and excreted primarily unchanged in 
      urine and faeces. Unchanged parent was the major drug-related component in 
      plasma. Metabolism was primarily via glucuronide conjugation.

TI  - Plasma Pharmacokinetic Determination of Canagliflozin and Its Metabolites in a 
      Type 2 Diabetic Rat Model by UPLC-MS/MS.
LID - 10.3390/molecules23051229 [doi]
LID - 1229
AB  - Canagliflozin is a novel, orally selective inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. In this study, a sensitive and efficient UPLC-MS/MS method for the 
      quantification of canagliflozin and its metabolites in rat plasma was established 
      and applied to pharmacokinetics in a type 2 diabetic rat model. We firstly 
      investigated the pharmacokinetic changes of canagliflozin and its metabolites in 
      type 2 diabetic rats in order to use canagliflozin more safely, reasonably and 
      effectively. We identified three types of O-glucuronide metabolites (M5, M7 and 
      M17), two kinds of oxidation metabolites (M8 and M9) and one oxidation and 
      glucuronide metabolite (M16) using API 5600 triple-TOF-MS/MS. Following 
      liquid⁻liquid extraction by tert-butyl methyl ether, chromatographic separation 
      of canagliflozin and its metabolites were performed on a Waters XBridge BEH C18 
      column (100 × 2.1 mm, 2.5 μm) using 0.1% acetonitrile⁻formic acid (75:15, v/v) as 
      the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Selected ion monitoring 
      transitions of m/z 462.00→191.10, 451.20→153.10, 638.10→191.10 and 478.00→267.00 
      were chosen to quantify canagliflozin, empagliflozin (IS), O-glucuronide 
      metabolites (M5, M7 and M17), and oxidation metabolites (M9) using an API 
      5500-triple-MS/MS in the positive electrospray ionization mode. The validation of 
      the method was found to be of sufficient specificity, accuracy and precision. The 
      pathological condition of diabetes could result in altered pharmacokinetic 
      behaviors of canagliflozin and its metabolites. The pharmacokinetic parameters 
      (AUC(0⁻t), AUC(0⁻∞), CL(z)/F, and V(z)/F) of canagliflozin were significantly 
      different between the CTRL and DM group rats (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), which may 
      subsequently cause different therapeutic effects.

AB  - Ipragliflozin is a highly potent and selective sodium-dependent glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, a novel class of hypoglycemic agents. The aim 
      of the present study was to establish a new highly sensitive and rapid liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantitative 
      analysis of ipragliflozin in rat plasma and apply this method to a 
      pharmacokinetic study in rats. Empagliflozin was used as an internal standard 
      (I.S.) and liquid-liquid extraction was conducted using tert-butyl methyl ether. 
      Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a Quicksorb ODS (2.1mm i.d.×150mm, 
      5μm in size) with acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 
      0.2mL/min. An API 3200 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the 
      positive electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring was used 
      to detect ipragliflozin and I.S. transitions: m/z 422.0 [M+NH4](+)→151.0 for 
      ipragliflozin and m/z 451.2 [M+H](+)→71.0 for I.S. Inter- and intra-day 
      accuracies and precisions were within ±15%. This validated method was 
      successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of ipragliflozin in rats. This 
      assay method may contribute to assessment of novel SGLT2 inhibitors using the rat 
      as an animal model.

      infections, urinary tract infection (UTI), and volume depletion] of the sodium 
      glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. This study extends the findings of previous analyses which 
      described the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) using early clinical studies of up to 
      12 weeks in duration. METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic and E-R models were 
      developed based on two Phase I, four Phase II, and four Phase III studies. 
      RESULTS: Variability in empagliflozin exposure was primarily affected by 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (less than twofold increase in 
      exposure in patients with severe renal impairment). Consistent with its mode of 
      action, the efficacy of empagliflozin was increased with elevated baseline plasma 
      glucose levels and attenuated with decreasing renal function, but was still 
      maintained to nearly half the maximal effect with eGFR as low as 
      30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). All other investigated covariates, including sex, body mass 
      index, race, and age did not alter the PK or efficacy of empagliflozin to a 
      clinically relevant extent. Compared with placebo, empagliflozin administration 
      was associated with an exposure-independent increase in the incidence of genital 
      infections and no significant change in the risk of UTI, hypoglycemia, or volume 
      depletion. CONCLUSION: Based on the results from the PK and E-R analysis, no dose 
      adjustment is required for empagliflozin in the patient population for which the 
      drug is approved. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.

      approach and its application to pharmacokinetic study.

AB  - A fast, sensitive one step UPLC ESI-MS/MS method was successfully applied for the 
      simultaneous estimation of two concurrently administrated antidiabetic drugs, 
      Metformin (MET) and Empagliflozin (EMPA) in human plasma. Metformin-d6 (MET-d6) 
      and Empagliflozin-d4 (EMPA-d4) were utilized as internal standards. Extraction of 
      the analytes from the human plasma was performed through acetonitrile 
      precipitation technique followed by freezing the precipitated plasma proteins and 
      lipids to minimize the matrix effect. Chromatographic analysis was developed on 
      Acquity UPLC BEH C(18) column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm) using isocratic elution mode. 
      A mobile phase of formic acid (0.01 %): acetonitrile (70:30 v/v) with a flow rate 
      of 0.3 mL/min achieved optimum separation. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in 
      positive ion mode, with transitions at (m/z) 130.14 →71.08 for (MET), 451.72 
      →71.29 for (EMPA), 136.03 →77.02 for (MET-d6), and 455.43 → 75.05 for (EMPA-d4) 
      was used for quantification. The obtained linearity covered the concentration 
      ranges of 10-1500 ng/mL and 2.0-250.0 ng/mL for MET and EMPA, respectively. The 
      run time of the proposed Method didn't exceed 3.0 min allowing faster analysis 
      and determination of larger number of samples per day without affecting accuracy 
      and sensitivity. The presented chromatographic method could be successfully 
      applied in pharmacokinetics studies and therapeutic monitoring of MET and EMPA in 
      patients' plasma administrating fixed dose combination of both drug with high 
      reproducibility and ruggedness.

TI  - Empagliflozin as adjunct to insulin in Japanese participants with type 1 
      diabetes: Results of a 4-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 
      2 trial.
PG  - 2190-2199
LID - 10.1111/dom.13351 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02702011) with 4 sites in Japan investigated the 
      pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profile of empagliflozin 
      in Japanese participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) as adjunctive 
      therapy to insulin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants using multiple daily 
      injections of insulin for ≥12 months, with HbA1c of 7.5%-10.0%, entered a 2-week, 
      open-label, placebo run-in period, followed by a 4-week, double-blind period 
      during which participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive empagliflozin 2.5 mg 
      (n = 13), empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 12), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 12) or placebo 
      (n = 11). The primary objective was to assess the effect of empagliflozin vs 
      placebo on urinary glucose excretion (UGE) after 7 days of treatment. RESULTS: 
      PD: Empagliflozin resulted in a dose-dependent significant increase in 24-hour 
      UGE compared with placebo (UGE placebo-corrected mean [95% confidence interval] 
      change from baseline: 2.5 mg, 65.10 [43.29, 86.90] g/24 h; 10 mg, 81.19 [58.80, 
      103.58] g/24 h; 25 mg, 98.11 [75.91, 120.31] g/24 h). After 4 weeks of treatment, 
      UGE increase was associated with improved glycaemic control, reduced body weight 
      and decreased insulin needs. Empagliflozin treatment also resulted in 
      dose-dependent increases in serum ketone bodies and free fatty acids. PK: Plasma 
      empagliflozin levels increased in a dose-dependent manner and peaked at 1.5 
      hours. In this short study, empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increase in 
      rate of hypoglycaemia and no diabetic ketoacidosis events reported. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Based on this short-duration phase 2 study, the PK/PD profile of empagliflozin in 
      Japanese participants with T1DM is comparable to that of non-Japanese 
      participants.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate the effects of coadministration of the sodium 
      glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin with the 
      thiazolidinedione pioglitazone. METHODS: In study 1, 20 healthy volunteers 
      received 50 mg of empagliflozin alone for 5 days, followed by 50 mg of 
      empagliflozin coadministered with 45 mg of pioglitazone for 7 days and 45 mg of 
      pioglitazone alone for 7 days in 1 of 2 treatment sequences. In study 2, 20 
      volunteers received 45 mg of pioglitazone alone for 7 days and 10, 25, and 50 mg 
      of empagliflozin for 9 days coadministered with 45 mg of pioglitazone for the 
      first 7 days in 1 of 4 treatment sequences. FINDINGS: Pioglitazone exposure (Cmax 
      and AUC) increased when coadministered with empagliflozin versus monotherapy in 
      study 1. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) for pioglitazone Cmax at steady state 
      (Cmax,ss) and for AUC during the dosing interval at steady state (AUCτ,ss) when 
      coadministered with empagliflozin versus administration alone was 187.89% (95% 
      CI, 166.35%-212.23%) and 157.97% (95% CI, 148.02%-168.58%), respectively. Because 
      an increase in pioglitazone exposure was not expected, based on in vitro data, a 
      second study was conducted with the empagliflozin doses tested in Phase III 
      trials. In study 2, pioglitazone exposure decreased marginally when 
      coadministered with empagliflozin. The GMR for pioglitazone Cmax,ss when 
      coadministered with empagliflozin versus administration alone was 87.74% (95% CI, 
      73.88%-104.21%) with empagliflozin 10 mg, 90.23% (95% CI, 66.84%-121.82%) with 
      empagliflozin 25 mg, and 89.85% (95% CI, 71.03%-113.66%) with empagliflozin 50 
      mg. The GMR for pioglitazone AUCτ,ss when coadministered with empagliflozin 
      versus administration alone was 90.01% (95% CI, 77.91%-103.99%) with 
      empagliflozin 10 mg, 88.98% (95% CI, 72.69%-108.92%) with empagliflozin 25 mg, 
      and 91.10% (95% CI, 77.40%-107.22%) with empagliflozin 50 mg. The effects of 
      empagliflozin on pioglitazone exposure are not considered to be clinically 
      relevant. Empagliflozin exposure was unaffected by coadministration with 
      pioglitazone. Empagliflozin and pioglitazone were well tolerated when 
      administered alone or in combination. In study 1, adverse events were reported in 
      1 of 19 participants on empagliflozin 50 mg alone, 4 of 20 on pioglitazone alone, 
      and 5 of 18 on combination treatment. In study 2, adverse events were reported in 
      8 of 20 participants on pioglitazone alone, 10 of 18 when coadministered with 
      empagliflozin 10 mg, 5 of 17 when coadministered with empagliflozin 25 mg, and 6 
      of 16 when coadministered with empagliflozin 50 mg. IMPLICATIONS: These results 
      indicate that pioglitazone and empagliflozin can be coadministered without dose 
      adjustments. EudraCT identifiers: 2008-006087-11 (study 1) and 2009-018089-36

TI  - Empagliflozin (BI 10773), a Potent and Selective SGLT2 Inhibitor, Induces 
      Dose-Dependent Glucosuria in Healthy Subjects.

AB  - Empagliflozin is an orally available, selective inhibitor of sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2. In this study, single oral doses of empagliflozin from 0.5 to 
      800 mg were not associated with any clinically significant safety concerns in 
      healthy male volunteers. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in 
      subjects receiving placebo (22.2%) or empagliflozin (25.0%) in the single rising 
      dose part of the study and after 50 mg empagliflozin under fed (28.6%) or fasted 
      (28.6%) conditions. The most frequent AE was headache. No clinically relevant 
      changes in laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were observed. 
      Single oral doses of empagliflozin were rapidly absorbed, reaching peak levels 
      after 1.0-2.1 hours. Increases in empagliflozin exposure were roughly 
      dose-proportional and a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion was 
      observed for empagliflozin doses up to 100 mg. After ingestion of 50 mg 
      empagliflozin in conjunction with a high-fat, high-calorie meal, no clinically 
      relevant changes in exposure were found, indicating that empagliflozin can be 
      administered independent of food. Empagliflozin up to 800 mg did not generate 
      clinically significant safety concerns in healthy male subjects. The 
      pharmacokinetic properties of empagliflozin support once daily administration 
      independent of food.

TI  - Development of simultaneous determination of empagliflozin and metformin in human 
      plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and application to 
      pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 117-130
LID - 10.1177/1469066719879297 [doi]
AB  - A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was 
      developed, optimized, and validated for simultaneous quantification of 
      empagliflozin and metformin in human plasma using empagliflozin D4and metformin 
      D6 as an internal standard. Analytes and internal standard were extracted from 
      plasma by optimized solid-phase extraction technique using Strata X polymeric 
      reverse phase (30 mg-1cc) solid-phase extraction cartridges. The prepared samples 
      were chromatographed on Orosil C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 3 µ). Separation was 
      done by pumping isocratic mobile phase consisting of methanol and 10 mM ammonium 
      trifluoroacetate (90:10, v/v) in positive ion mode at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. 
      The API 3200 liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system having turbo ion 
      spray as an ion source coupled with Shimadzu Prominence ultrafast liquid 
      chromatography system was operated under the selected reaction monitoring mode. 
      Turbo ion spray ionization was used for mass transition of m/z 468.070/355.100 
      and m/z 130.072/71.200 for empagliflozin and metformin, respectively. A method 
      was successfully validated for concentration range of 10.09-5013.46 ng/mL for 
      both the analytes and according to the United States Food and Drugs 
      Administration guidelines. The linearity was found to be in the range of 
      10.09-403.46 ng/mL for empagliflozin and 25.44-5013.46 ng/mL for metformin. The 
      limit of quantification was found to be 10.09 ng/mL for empagliflozin and 
      25.44 ng/mL for metformin. Intra- and inter-day/between batch precision 
      determination for empagliflozin and metformin, expressed as coefficient of 
      variation were within the acceptance limits and ranged below 13.16%. A short run 
      time of 3.3 min allows analysis of more than 400 plasma samples per day. The 
      developed method was successfully applied to fasting pharmacokinetic study in 
      healthy human volunteers. Results of incurred sample re-analysis were within the 
      acceptance range of ±20% of original value, for 97.2% of samples reanalyzed for 
      empagliflozin and 100% of samples reanalyzed for metformin.

TI  - Exposure-response modelling for empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 
      (SGLT2) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1407-18
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12453 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To provide model-based clinical development decision support including dose 
      selection guidance for empagliflozin, an orally administered sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitor, through developed exposure-response (E-R) models for 
      efficacy and tolerability in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      METHODS: Five randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple oral dose studies of 
      empagliflozin in patients with T2DM (n = 974; 1-100 mg once daily, duration ≤12 
      weeks) were used to develop E-R models for efficacy (glycosylated haemoglobin 
      [HbA1c ], fasting plasma glucose [FPG] and urinary glucose excretion). Two 
      studies (n = 748, 12 weeks) were used to evaluate tolerability E-R. RESULTS: The 
      efficacy model predicted maximal decreases in FPG and HbA1c of 16% and 0.6%, 
      respectively, assuming a baseline FPG concentration of 8 mm (144 mg dl(-1) ) and 
      10-25 mg every day empagliflozin targeted 80-90% of these maximums. Increases in 
      exposure had no effect on incidence rates of hypoglycaemia (n = 4), urinary tract 
      infection (n = 17) or genital/vulvovaginal-related (n = 16) events, although low 
      prevalence rates may have precluded more accurate evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: E-R 
      analyses indicated that 10 and 25 mg once daily empagliflozin doses achieved near 
      maximal glucose lowering efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is a potent, oral, selective inhibitor of sodium 
      glucose cotransporter 2 in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. OBJECTIVE: The goal of these studies was to investigate potential 
      drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and gemfibrozil (an organic 
      anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 [OATP1B1]/1B3 and organic anion transporter 3 
      [OAT3] inhibitor), rifampicin (an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor), or probenecid (an OAT3 
      and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase inhibitor). METHODS: Two 
      open-label, randomized, crossover studies were undertaken in healthy subjects. In 
      the first study, 18 subjects received the following in 1 of 2 randomized 
      treatment sequences: a single dose of empagliflozin 25 mg alone and gemfibrozil 
      600 mg BID for 5 days with a single dose of empagliflozin 25 mg on the third day. 
      In the second study, 18 subjects received a single dose of empagliflozin 10 mg, a 
      single dose of empagliflozin 10 mg coadministered with a single dose of 
      rifampicin 600 mg, and probenecid 500 mg BID for 4 days with a single dose of 
      empagliflozin 10 mg on the second day in 1 of 6 randomized treatment sequences. 
      RESULTS: In the gemfibrozil study, 11 subjects were male, mean age was 35.1 years 
      and mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.47 kg/m(2). In the rifampicin/probenecid 
      study, 10 subjects were male, mean age was 32.7 years and mean BMI was 23.03 
      kg/m(2). Exposure to empagliflozin was increased by coadministration with 
      gemfibrozil (AUC0-∞: geometric mean ratio [GMR], 158.50% [90% CI, 151.77-165.53]; 
      Cmax: GMR, 115.00% [90% CI, 106.15-124.59]), rifampicin (AUC0-∞: GMR, 135.20% 
      [90% CI, 129.58-141.06]; Cmax: GMR, 175.14% [90% CI, 160.14-191.56]), and 
      probenecid (AUC0-∞: GMR, 153.47% [90% CI, 146.41-160.88]; Cmax: GMR, 125.60% [90% 
      CI, 113.67-138.78]). All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Increases 
      in empagliflozin exposure were <2-fold, indicating that the inhibition of the 
      OATP1B1/1B3, OAT3 transporter, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases 
      did not have a clinically relevant effect on empagliflozin exposure. No dose 
      adjustments of empagliflozin were necessary when it was coadministered with 
      gemfibrozil, rifampicin, or probenecid. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: 
      NCT01301742 and NCT01634100.

AB  - AIMS: Empagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      This study assessed pharmacological properties of empagliflozin in vitro and 
      pharmacokinetic properties in vivo and compared its potency and selectivity with 
      other SGLT-2 inhibitors. METHODS: [(14)C]-alpha-methyl glucopyranoside (AMG) 
      uptake experiments were performed with stable cell lines over-expressing human 
      (h) SGLT-1, 2 and 4. Two new cell lines over-expressing hSGLT-5 and hSGLT-6 were 
      established and [(14)C]-mannose and [(14)C]-myo-inositol uptake assays developed. 
      Binding kinetics were analysed using a radioligand binding assay with 
      [(3)H]-labelled empagliflozin and HEK293-hSGLT-2 cell membranes. Acute in vivo 
      assessment of pharmacokinetics was performed with normoglycaemic beagle dogs and 
      Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. RESULTS: Empagliflozin has an IC(50) of 3.1 nM 
      for hSGLT-2. Its binding to SGLT-2 is competitive with glucose (half-life 
      approximately 1 h). Compared with other SGLT-2 inhibitors, empagliflozin has a 
      high degree of selectivity over SGLT-1, 4, 5 and 6. Species differences in SGLT-1 
      selectivity were identified. Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics in ZDF rats were 
      characterised by moderate total plasma clearance (CL) and bioavailability (BA), 
      while in beagle dogs CL was low and BA was high. CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin is a 
      potent and competitive SGLT-2 inhibitor with an excellent selectivity profile and 
      the highest selectivity window of the tested SGLT-2 inhibitors over hSGLT-1. 
      Empagliflozin represents an innovative therapeutic approach to treat diabetes.

TI  - A new HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of SGLT2 inhibitors 
      and metformin in plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - e4663

AB  - Monitoring the plasma concentrations of metformin and sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) is 
      essential for pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies and therapeutic 
      monitoring. The present work therefore aimed to develop and validate a 
      high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
      (HPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of these drugs in human 
      plasma. The analyses were performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system coupled to 
      an Applied Biosystems API 3200 triple quadrupole MS/MS with electrospray 
      ionization in positive ion mode. After one-step protein precipitation of plasma 
      with acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, chromatographic separation was 
      achieved on an Xbridge C(18) column, with a mobile phase consisting of a gradient 
      of water and acetonitrile, both containing 1 mm ammonium formate and 0.1% formic 
      acid. Quantification was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode using m/z 
      130.1 → 71.1 for metformin, m/z 462.0 → 191.2 for canagliflozin, m/z 
      426.1 → 167.1 for dapagliflozin and m/z 468.0 → 354.9 for empagliflozin. The 
      proposed method was validated and demonstrated to be adequate for the 
      quantification of metformin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin for 
      clinical monitoring, pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence studies.

AB  - AIM: Janagliflozin is an orally selective SGLT2 inhibitor. To predict human 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) characteristics of janagliflozin. To 
      design optimal starting dose and effective dose for janagliflozin first-in-human 
      (FIH) study. METHODS: Animal PK/PD properties of janagliflozin were obtained from 
      preclinical in vivo and in vitro study. Pharmacologically effective level of same 
      class SGLT2 inhibitors were assessed through preclinical and clinical efficacy 
      data of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin. Human PK parameters and 
      profiles of janagliflozin were predicted by various methods such as allometric 
      scaling (AS), dedrick and PK/PD modeling analysis. Mechanistic PK/PD model was 
      developed to describe janagliflozin-mediated impact on urinary glucose excretion 
      (UGE). Human IC(50) was scaled from rat model-estimated IC(50) by correcting 
      interspecies difference of in vitro IC(50) and plasma f(u) of rat and human. The 
      quantitative PK/PD prediction of janagliflozin was evaluated via observed PK/PD 
      profiles of healthy subjects. Predicted PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin 
      were applied in FIH dose design. Optimal starting dose was suggested by 
      considering preclinical PD and toxicity data of janagliflozin. Effective dose was 
      suggested by considering pharmacologically effective level of same class drugs. 
      RESULTS: PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin in preclinical species were 
      summarized. Pharmacologically effective level for SGLT2 inhibitors was defined as 
      25~30% ΔUGE (ΔUGE=--(PG*GFR)(within24h)) based on efficacy data of three same 
      class drugs. Human predicted CL, V(ss) and F were 1.04 L/h, 77.5 L and 0.80. 
      Predicted AUC and C(max) of janagliflozin of 10 and 50 mg were within 0.47~2.08 
      fold of observed values. Predicted human UGE(0-)24 h and UGE(0-)144 h of 10 and 
      50 mg dose range were within 0.66~1.41 fold of observed values. Optimal starting 
      dose and pharmacologically active dose (PAD) were suggested as 10 mg and 50 mg. 
      Dose range for FIH study was designed as 10-450 mg. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      predicted human PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin based on preclinical data 
      and provide optimal dose design for janagliflozin FIH study based on 
      pharmacologically effective level of same class drugs.

      empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 721-8
LID - 10.1111/dom.12081 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated 
      the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Four hundred and eight patients 
      (treatment-naïve or after a 4-week wash-out period) were randomized to receive 
      empagliflozin 5, 10 or 25 mg once daily, placebo or open-label metformin for 
      12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 
      12 weeks. RESULTS: After 12 weeks' treatment, empagliflozin showed dose-dependent 
      reductions in HbA1c from baseline [5 mg: -0.4%, 10 mg: -0.5%, 25 mg: -0.6%; all 
      doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.09%)]. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased 
      with empagliflozin [5 mg: -1.29 mmol/l, 10 mg: -1.61 mmol/l, 25 mg: -1.72 mmol/l; 
      all doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.04 mmol/l)]. Body weight decreased in all 
      empagliflozin groups (all doses p < 0.001 vs. placebo). The incidence of adverse 
      events (AEs) was similar in the placebo (32.9%) and empagliflozin (29.1%) groups. 
      The most frequently reported AEs on empagliflozin were pollakiuria (3.3% vs. 0% 
      for placebo), thirst (3.3% vs. 0% for placebo) and nasopharyngitis (2.0% vs. 1.2% 
      for placebo). AEs consistent with urinary tract infections (UTIs) were reported 
      in four (1.6%) patients on empagliflozin vs. one (1.2%) on placebo. Genital 
      infections were reported in five (2%) patients on empagliflozin vs. 0% on 
      placebo. No UTIs or genital infections led to premature discontinuation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin resulted in 
      dose-dependent, clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and FPG, and reductions 
      in body weight compared with placebo. Empagliflozin was well-tolerated with a 
      favourable safety profile.

AB  - An efficient, accurate and sensitive spectrofluorimetric method was developed for 
      analysis of empagliflozin (EGF) in pure form, dosage form and human plasma. The 
      proposed procedure was based on formation of yellow fluorescent product between 
      benzofurazan reagent and empagliflozin in slightly alkaline medium that is 
      measured at 521 nm, when excitation at 455 nm. The present study was validated 
      according to ICH guidelines and bioanalytical validated according to US-FDA 
      guidance. The fluorescence intensity-concentration plot was linear over the range 
      of 50-1000 ng ml(-1) with limit of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) of 
      15.55 and 46.63 ng ml(-1), respectively. The correlation (r) and determination 
      (r(2)) coefficient was 0.9998 and 0.9997, respectively. Due to high sensitivity 
      and selectivity of the proposed method, it is successfully used for analysis of 
      empagliflozin in its dosage form and human plasma with good recoveries of 98.89% 
      and 98.70%, respectively, without any interfering from matrix components. The 
      corresponding regression equation, Y = 0.756X + 141.93, (r(2) = 0.9994) for 
      spiked plasma sample. Two level full factorial designs were used to study 
      different experimental parameters that affect the reaction product and to get the

AB  - Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. SGLT2 
      cotransporters are responsible for reabsorption of 90 % of the glucose filtered 
      by the kidney. The glucuretic effect resulting from SGLT2 inhibition contributes 
      to reduce hyperglycaemia and also assists weight loss and blood pressure 
      reduction. Several SGLT2 inhibitors are already available in many countries 
      (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) and in Japan (ipragliflozin, 
      tofogliflozin). These SGLT2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics with a rapid oral absorption, a long elimination half-life 
      allowing once-daily administration, an extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via 
      glucuronidation to inactive metabolites and a low renal elimination as a parent 
      drug. Pharmacokinetic parameters are slightly altered in the case of chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). While no dose adjustment is required in the case of mild 
      CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors may not be used or only at a lower daily dose in patients 
      with moderate CKD. Furthermore, the pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors 
      as assessed by urinary glucose excretion declines with increasing severity of 
      renal impairment as assessed by a reduction in the estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate. Nevertheless, the glucose-lowering efficacy and safety of SGLT2 
      inhibitors are almost comparable in patients with mild CKD as in patients with 
      normal kidney function. In patients with moderate CKD, the efficacy tends to be 
      dampened and safety concerns may occur. In patients with severe CKD, the use of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors is contraindicated. Thus, prescribing information should be 
      consulted regarding dosage adjustments or restrictions in the case of renal 
      dysfunction for each SGLT2 inhibitor. The clinical impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on 
      renal function and their potential to influence the course of diabetic 
      nephropathy deserve attention because of preliminary favourable results in animal 
      models.

AB  - The sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 offer a novel approach to treating type 
      2 diabetes by reducing hyperglycaemia via increased urinary glucose excretion. In 
      the present study, the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacologic 
      properties of all six SGLT2 inhibitors commercially available in Japan were 
      investigated and compared. Based on findings in normal and diabetic mice, the six 
      drugs were classified into two categories, long-acting: ipragliflozin and 
      dapagliflozin, and intermediate-acting: tofogliflozin, canagliflozin, 
      empagliflozin, and luseogliflozin. Long-acting SGLT2 inhibitors exerted an 
      antihyperglycemic effect with lower variability of blood glucose level via a 
      long-lasting increase in urinary glucose excretion. In addition, ipragliflozin 
      and luseogliflozin exhibited superiority over the others with respect to fast 
      onset of pharmacological effect. Duration and onset of the pharmacologic effects 
      seemed to be closely correlated with the pharmacokinetic properties of each SGLT2 
      inhibitor, particularly with respect to high distribution and long retention in 
      the target organ, the kidney. While all six SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly 
      effective in increasing urinary glucose excretion and reducing hyperglycemia, our 
      findings suggest that variation in the quality of daily blood glucose control 
      associated with duration and onset of pharmacologic effects of each SGLT2 
      inhibitor might cause slight differences in rates of improvement in type 2 
      diabetes.

TI  - Organic anion transporter OAT3 enhances the glucosuric effect of the SGLT2 
      inhibitor empagliflozin.
PG  - F386-F394
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00503.2017 [doi]
AB  - The sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin (plasma protein 
      binding ~88%) may reach its target in the brush border of the early proximal 
      tubule by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Here we determined whether 
      empagliflozin is secreted by renal tubules in mice and whether genetic knockout 
      of the basolateral organic anion transporter 3 ( Oat3-/-) affects its tubular 
      secretion or glucosuric effect. Renal clearance studies in wild-type (WT) mice 
      showed that tubular secretion accounted for 50-70% of empagliflozin urinary 
      excretion. Immunostaining indicated that SGLT2 and OAT3 localization partially 
      overlapped in proximal tubule S1 and S2 segments. Glucosuria in metabolic cage 
      studies was reduced in Oat3-/- vs. WT mice for acute empagliflozin doses of 1, 3, 
      and 10 mg/kg, whereas 30 mg/kg induced similar maximal glucosuria in both 
      genotypes. Chronic application of empagliflozin (~25 mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1)) in 
      Oat3-/- mice was associated with lower urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratios 
      despite maintaining slightly higher blood glucose levels than WT. On a whole 
      kidney level, renal secretion of empagliflozin was largely unchanged in Oat3-/- 
      mice. However, the absence of OAT3 attenuated the influence of empagliflozin on 
      fractional glucose excretion; higher levels of plasma or filtered empagliflozin 
      were needed to induce similar increases in fractional renal glucose excretion. We 
      conclude that empagliflozin is excreted into the urine to similar extent by 
      glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. The latter can occur largely 
      independent of OAT3. However, OAT3 increases the glucosuric effect of 
      empagliflozin, which may relate to the partial overlap of its localization with 
      SGLT2 and thus OAT3-mediated tubular secretion of empagliflozin in the early 
      proximal tubule.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 -inhibitors (SGLT2i) are oral glucose-lowering 
      drugs that have also demonstrated cardioprotective and renoprotective effects. 
      SGLT2i play an increasingly important role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
      Here we report a simple and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of three SGLT2i 
      (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) in human plasma, serum and urine 
      with a runtime of 1 min. Methanol was used as protein precipitating agent. 
      Chromatographic separation was accomplished using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 
      1.8 μm; 2.1 × 50 mm column with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm VanGuard 
      Pre-column; 2.1 × 5 mm, using gradient elution with ammonium acetate 20 mM (pH 5) 
      and acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Mass spectrometric 
      analysis of the acetate adduct ions was carried out using electrospray with 
      negative ionization and SRM mode. The assay was validated according to FDA and 
      EMA guidelines, including selectivity, linearity, accuracy and precision, 
      dilution integrity, stability and recovery. With a sample volume of 200 µl, 
      linear ranges of 10-5000 µg/L, 1-500 µg/L and 2-1000 µg/L for canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin respectively, were achieved. The assay was 
      successfully applied in two pharmacokinetic studies with dapagliflozin and 
      empagliflozin. In conclusion, we developed and validated a simple, fast and 
      robust LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, that allows rapid analysis of large numbers of 
      samples and can be used for both pharmacokinetic studies and biomedical analysis 
      of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.

AB  - Optimization of extraction and chromatographic conditions is essential for the 
      simultaneous analysis of drugs having different physico-chemical properties, 
      especially for in vivo applications. The present work describes concurrent 
      estimation of metformin (MET) and three sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitors namely canagliflozin (CANA), dapagliflozin (DAPA) and empagliflozin 
      (EMPA) in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). Sample clean-up was optimized using ion-pair solid-phase extraction 
      with sodium lauryl sulphate on Strata-X extraction cartridges. Consistent 
      recoveries were obtained by critically optimizing parameters such as washing and 
      elution solvents during extraction. The extraction recovery ranged from 79 to 88% 
      for all the analytes. Chromatographic separation were accomplished on a Cyano 
      (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column within 5.0 min using acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium 
      formate buffer (75:25, v/v) as the mobile phase. The resolution factors between 
      MET-EMPA, MET-DAPA, MET-CANA, DAPA-EMPA and CANA-DAPA were 4.92, 5.85, 7.13, 1.01 
      and 1.44, respectively. Calibration curves were linear in the concentration range 
      of 2.00-2000, 3.00-3000, 0.20-200 and 1.50-1500 ng/mL for MET, CANA, DAPA and 
      EMPA, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a polarity 
      switching approach to achieve high sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring 
      mode. The method was validated using current regulatory guidelines and applied to 
      study the pharmacokinetics of fixed-dose formulations of MET and SGLT-2 
      inhibitors in healthy subjects.

TI  - Evaluating SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes: pharmacokinetic and 
      toxicological considerations.
PG  - 647-63
LID - 10.1517/17425255.2014.873788 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2), which 
      increase urinary glucose excretion independently of insulin, are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). AREAS 
      COVERED: An extensive literature search was performed to analyze the 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics, toxicological issues and safety concerns of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors in humans. This review focuses on three compounds 
      (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) with results obtained in healthy 
      volunteers (including drug-drug interactions), patients with T2DM (single dose 
      and multiple doses) and special populations (those with renal or hepatic 
      impairment). EXPERT OPINION: The three pharmacological agents share an excellent 
      oral bioavailability, long half-life allowing once-daily administration, low 
      accumulation index and renal clearance, the absence of active metabolites and a 
      limited propensity to drug-drug interactions. No clinically relevant changes in 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in T2DM patients or in patients with 
      mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment. Adverse events are a slightly 
      increased incidence of mycotic genital and rare benign urinary infections. SGLT2 
      inhibitors have the potential to reduce several cardiovascular risk factors, and 
      cardiovascular outcome trials are currently ongoing. The best positioning of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors in the armamentarium for treating T2DM is still a matter of 
      debate.

TI  - Low-dose empagliflozin as adjunct-to-insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes: A valid 
      modelling and simulation analysis to confirm efficacy.
PG  - 427-433
LID - 10.1111/dom.13945 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To confirm the observed reduction in HbA1c for the 2.5 mg dose in EASE-3 by 
      modelling and simulation analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Independent of data 
      from EASE-3 that tested 2.5 mg, we simulated the effect of a 2.5 mg dose through 
      patient-level, exposure-response modelling in the EASE-2 clinical study. A 
      primary semi-mechanistic model evaluated efficacy considering clinical insulin 
      dose adjustments made after treatment initiation that potentially limited HbA1c 
      reductions. The model was informed by pharmacokinetic, insulin dose, mean daily 
      glucose and HbA1c data, and was verified by comparing the simulations with the 
      observed HbA1c change in EASE-3. One of two empagliflozin phase 3 trials in type 
      1 diabetes (EASE-3 but not EASE-2) included a lower 2.5 mg dose. A 
      placebo-corrected HbA1c reduction of 0.28% was demonstrated without the increased 
      risk of diabetic ketoacidosis observed at higher doses (10 mg and 25 mg). Since 
      only one trial included the lower dose, we aimed to confirm the observed 
      reduction in HbA1c for the 2.5 mg dose by modelling and simulation analyses. 
      RESULTS: The simulated 26-week mean HbA1c change was -0.41% without insulin dose 
      adjustment and -0.29% at 26 weeks with insulin dose adjustment. A simplified 
      (descriptive) model excluding insulin dose and mean daily glucose confirmed the 
      -0.29% HbA1c change that would have been observed had the EASE-2 population 
      received a 2.5 mg dose for 26/52 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The HbA1c benefit of 
      low-dose empagliflozin directly observed in the EASE-3 trial was confirmed by two 
      modelling and simulation approaches.
