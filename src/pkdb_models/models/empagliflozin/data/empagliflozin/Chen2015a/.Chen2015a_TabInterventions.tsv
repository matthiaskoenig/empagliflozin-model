Chen2015a	EMP50	0	NA	hr	oral	single dose	dosing	solution	empagliflozin	49.1	mg	Subjects received 50 mg empagliflozin containing [14C]-radiolabelled empagliflozin
Chen2015a	C14EMP	0	NA	hr	oral	single dose	dosing	solution	C14-empagliflozin	0.9	mg	A mixture of empagliflozin and [14C]-empagliflozin was reconstituted with polyethylene glycol 400/water (60/40, w/w) at a concentration of 5 mg/g to provide a radioactive dose of ~100 mCi per subject (49.1 mg empagliflozin plus 0.9 mg [14C]-empagliflozin, adjusted according to the specific activity). The specific activity of [14C]-empagliflozin was 2.13 mCi/mg.
