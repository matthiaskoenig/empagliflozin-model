Heise2013	Placebo	0|2|3|4|5|6|7|8	NA	day	oral	multiple dose	dosing	tablet	empagliflozin	0.0	mg	receive one of four doses of empagliﬂozin (2.5, 10, 25, or 100 mg qd) or placebo over 8 days. Patients received a single dose on day 1 and once-daily dosing on days 3–9. The dosing on day 2 was skipped to allow estimation of the terminal elimination half-life after a single dose to compare with the steady state half-life. Study drug was administered at the same time every day with 240 mL of water. Patients were fasted overnight for 10 h on days -2, -1, 1, 8, and 9.
